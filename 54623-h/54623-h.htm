<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In the following pages will be found short and
simple descriptions of some of the numerous objects
that are to be found in our fields, woods, and
waters.</p>

<p>As this little work is not intended for scientific
readers, but simply as a guide to those who are desirous
of learning something of natural objects,
scientific language has been studiously avoided, and
scientific names have been only given in cases where
no popular name can be found. In so small a compass
but little can be done; and therefore I have
been content to take certain typical objects, which
will serve as guides, and to omit mention of those
which can be placed under the same head.</p>

<p>Every object described by the pen is illustrated
by the pencil, in order to aid the reader in his researches;
and the subjects have been so chosen that
no one with observant eyes can walk in the fields
for half-an-hour without finding very many of the
objects described in the book.</p>

</div>

<p>Every one has read, or at least heard of, the tale
entitled “Eyes and no Eyes”; which tale is to be
found in the <cite>Evenings at Home</cite>. Now this story,
or rather the moral of it, is, in my opinion, as often
used unfairly as rightly.</p>

<p>Although there are those who pass through life
with closed eyes and stopped ears, yet there are
many more who would be glad to use their eyes and
ears, but know not how to do so for want of proper
teaching. To one who has not learned to read, the
Bible itself is but a series of senseless black marks;
and similarly, the unwritten Word that lies around,
below, and above us, is unmeaning to those who
cannot read it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Many would like to read, but cannot do so; and it
is in order to help such, to bring before them the
first alphabetical teaching, that the following pages
are written.</p>

<p>It is no matter of marvel that many an observant
person becomes bewildered among natural objects;
that he is lost amid the variety of animal, vegetable,
and mineral life in which he lives; and that, after
vainly attempting to comprehend some simple object,
he finds himself baffled, and so in despair
ceases to inquire into particulars, and contents himself
with admiration of and love for nature in
general.</p>

<p>Objects change so rapidly and so constantly, that
there is hardly time to note a few remarks before the
season has passed away; the object under examination
has changed with it, and a year must elapse
before that investigation can be continued.</p>

<p>From experience I know how valuable are even a
few hints by which the mind can be directed in a
straight course without wasting its strength and
losing its time by devious wanderings. Only hints
can be given, for the limits of the volume forbid any
lengthened discussion of single objects; and, besides,
the mind is more pleased to work out a subject
according to its own individuality than to have it
laid down as completed, and to be forbidden to go
any further.</p>

<p>Almost every object that is described by the pen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
will be figured by the pencil, in order to assist the
reader in identifying the creature in an easier manner
than if it were merely described in words.</p>

<p>Of the birds I shall not be able to treat, as they
alone would occupy the entire space of this volume;
and, for the same reason, only a short account can
be given of each object.</p>

<p>As in the scale of creation the mammals fill the
highest place, we will speak of them first, taking, as
far as possible, each creature in its own order.</p>

<p>Perhaps there are few people who would not feel
some surprise when they learn that the very highest
of our British animals is the Bat. Usually the bat
is looked upon with rather a feeling of dread, and is
regarded as a creature of such ill-omen that its very
presence causes a shudder, and its approach would
put to flight many a human being.</p>

<p>There is certainly some ground for this feeling;
for the night-loving propensities of the creature, its
weird-like aspect, its strange devious flight, and more
especially its organs of flight, are so interwoven with
the popular ideas of evil and its ministers, that bats
and imps appear to be synonymous terms.</p>

<p>Painters always represent their imps as upborne
by bats’ wings, furnished with several supplementary
hooks; and sculptors follow the same principle.</p>

<p>In consequence, all bats and objects connected with
bats are viewed with great horror, with two exceptions:
a cricket-bat and a bat’s-wing gas-burner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, I cannot but think that this is very hard on
the bats. It is said that the African negroes depict
and describe <em>their</em> evil spirits as white; and that, in
consequence, the negro children fly in consternation
if perchance a white man comes into their territory.</p>

<p>Yet, a white man is not so very horrid an object
after all, if one only dare look at him; and the same
remark holds good with the bats.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus1.jpg" width="300" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption">COMMON LONG-EARED BAT.</p>
</div>

<p>A very pretty creature is a bat, more especially
the long-eared species, <i>Plecotus communis</i>, as it is
scientifically called, and its habits are most curious.
It is well worth the time to watch these little creatures
on a warm summer’s night, as they flit about
in the air, and to note the enjoyment of their aërial
hunt. They are fearless animals; and provided that
the observer remains tolerably still and does not
speak, bats will often flit so close to his face that he
could almost catch them in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Their flight is very singular, and reminds one of
the butterfly in its apparently vague flitting. Indeed,
there are many large moths that fly by night
who can hardly be distinguished from the bats, if the
evening be rather dark, so similar are they in their
mode of journeying through the air.</p>

<p>From this peculiarity of flight, they are accounted
difficult marks for a gun; and it is unfortunately a
custom with some ruthless powder-burners to practise
by day at swallows and by night at bats. Now,
even putting the matter in its lowest form, it is
wrong to shoot swallows; for they are most useful
birds, and serve to thin the host of flies and other
insects that people the summer air.</p>

<p>As regards the swallow, this is well known, and
does serve to protect it from some persons who have
more compassion than the generality. Moreover,
the swallows, swifts, and martins are extremely
pretty birds, and their beauty is in some degree their
shield.</p>

<p>But the bat is as useful a creature as the swallow,
and in the very same way; for, when the evening
comes on, and the swallow retires to its nest, the bat
issues from its home and takes up the work just
where the swallow leaves it&mdash;the two creatures
dividing the day and night between them. Therefore,
let those who refrain from swallow shooting include
the bat in their free list.</p>

<p>Some there are whom nothing can restrain from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
killing, for the instinct of slaughter is strong in them.
With them nothing is valuable unless it is to be
killed. If it can be eaten afterwards, so much the
better; but the great enjoyment consists in the
mere act of killing.</p>

<p>They contrive to disguise the ugliness of the thing
by giving it any name but the right one; but, in
spite of the name, the thing exists. And I wonder,
if they were to look very closely into themselves,
whether they would not find there a decided desire
to kill men, provided that they had no reason to dread
the consequences. Those who have practised the
sport unanimously say that nothing is so exciting as
man-hunting and killing and that all other sport is
tame in comparison.</p>

<p>The chief name under which this profanity is disguised
is that of “Sport,” a word which always reminds
me of the “Frog and Boys” fable. There
are actually men who are audacious enough to declare
that there is no cruelty in “sport”; that foxes
are charmed at being hunted, and that pheasants
derive a singular gratification from getting shot.
Now, I never was either a fox or a pheasant; but I
entirely repudiate the assertion that any animal likes
to be chased or to be wounded; and, moreover, I
disbelieve the sincerity of the man who can say such
a thing. If he says openly that he finds excitement
in the chase, and means to gratify himself without
any reference to the feelings of the creatures which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
he chases, I can understand while I disapprove. But
when a man justifies himself by asserting that any
animal likes to be hunted, I can hardly find epithets
too contemptuous for him; and I could see him run
the gauntlet among the Sioux Indians with but small
pangs of conscience.</p>

<p>Some again call themselves Naturalists, and under
the shelter of that high-sounding name occupy themselves
in destroying nature. The true naturalist
never destroys life without good cause, and when he
does so, it is with reluctance, and in the most
merciful way; for the life is really the nature, and
that gone, the chief interest of the creature is gone
too. We should form but a poor notion of the
human being were we only to see it presented to our
eyes in the mummy; and equally insufficient is the
idea that can be formed of an animal from the inspection
of its outward frame. Nature and life belong
to each other; and, if torn asunder, the one is objectless
and the other gone.</p>

<p>Lastly, let me remind those who find such gratification
in destroying, that the word “Destroyer” is
in the Greek language “Apollyon”.</p>

<p>As we do not intend to treat of the dead and dried
bodies of animals, but of their active life, we return
to our bat flitting in the evening dusk, and, instead
of shooting him, watch his proceedings.</p>

<p>Every creature is made for happiness, and receives
happiness according to its capacity; and it is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
wrong to suppose that, because <em>we</em> should be miserable
if we led the life of a vulture, or a sloth, or a bat,
therefore those creatures are miserable. In truth,
the vulture is attracted to, and feels its greatest gratification
in, those substances which would drive us
away with averted eyes and stopped nostrils. The
sloth is, on the authority of Waterton, quite a jovial
beast, and anything but slothful when in his proper
place; and as for the bat, it sings for very joy. True,
the song is not very melodious, neither is that of the
swift, or the peacock, nor, perhaps, that of the
Cochin-China fowl, but it is nevertheless a song
from the abundance of the heart.</p>

<p>There are many human ears that are absolutely incapable
of perceiving the cry of the bat, so keen and
sharp is the note; a very razor’s-edge of sound.</p>

<p>More than once I have been standing in a field
over which bats were flying in multitudes, filling the
air almost oppressively with their sharp needle-like
cries. Yet my companion, who was a musician,
theoretically and practically, was unable to hear a
sound, and could not for some time believe me when
I spoke of the noisy little creatures above.</p>

<p>The sound bears some resemblance to that produced
by a slate-pencil when held perpendicularly in
writing on the slate, only the bat’s cry is several
octaves more acute. I never but once heard the
sound correctly imitated, and that was done by a
graceless urchin, during a long sermon one Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
morning. He had contrived to arrange two keys in
such a manner that, when grated over each other,
they produced a squeaking sound that exactly resembled
the cry uttered by the bat. So, by judicious
management of his keys, he kept the congregation
on the look-out for the bat, and beguiled the time
much to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>Of so piercing and peculiar a nature is the cry,
that it gives no clue to the position or distance of
the creature that utters it, and it seems to proceed
indiscriminately from any portion of the air towards
which the attention happens to be directed. The
note of the grasshopper lark possesses somewhat of
the same quality.</p>

<p>Even in confinement the bat is an interesting
creature, and discovers certain traits of character
and peculiarities of habit which in its wild state cannot
be seen. I might here refer to several stories
of domesticated and tamed bats; but as they have
already been given to the world, and my space is
limited, I prefer to give my own experiences.</p>

<p>Not long ago, I received a message from a neighbouring
grocer, requesting me to capture a bat which
had flown into the shop, and which no one dared
touch.</p>

<p>When I arrived, the creature had taken refuge
on an upper shelf, and had crawled among a pile of
sugar-loaves that were lying on their sides after the
usual custom. We pulled out several loaves near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the spot where the bat was last seen, and by casting
a strong light from a bull’s-eye lantern, discovered a
little black object snugly ensconced at the very back
of the shelf.</p>

<p>I pushed my hand towards the spot, but for some
time could not seize the creature, as it was so tightly
packed, and squeezed into a corner. At last the bat
gave a flap with one of the wings, which I caught,
and so gently drew my prisoner forwards.</p>

<p>He was a brave little fellow, as well as discreet,
and bit savagely at my fingers. However, his little
tiny teeth could not do much damage, and I put
him into a cage which I brought with me.</p>

<p>The cage was originally made for the reception of
mice, and was of a rude character&mdash;the back and
ends being of wood and the front of wire. In a very
few minutes after his entrance into the cage, the bat
climbed up the wooden back, by hitching his claws
into the slight inequalities of the wood, and there
hung suspended, head downwards.</p>

<p>When so placed, his aspect was curious enough.
The claws of the hind legs being fixed into a crevice,
so as to bear the weight of the body, the wings were
then extended to their utmost, and suddenly wrapped
round the body. At the same time the large ears
were folded back under the wings and protected by
them, the orifice of the ear itself being guarded in a
very singular manner.</p>

<p>If the reader will refer to the figure of the bat on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>, he will see that inside the great ear is a
sharply-pointed membrane, somewhat resembling a
second ear. This membrane is called the “<em>tragus</em>,”
and when the large ears are tucked away out of
sight, the tragus remains exposed, and gives the
creature a very strange appearance.</p>

<p>When the bat is living, the ears are of singular
beauty. Their substance is delicate, and semi-transparent
if viewed against the light; so much so, indeed,
that by the aid of a microscope the circulation
of the blood can be detected. As the creature moves
about, the ears are continually in motion, being
thrown into graceful and ever-changing curves. If
people only knew what a pretty pet the long-eared
bat can become, they would soon banish dormice
and similar creatures in favour of bats.</p>

<p>It was rather a remarkable circumstance, that the
bat of which I have just been speaking would not
touch a fly, although one which I had in my possession
some ten years since would eat flies and other
insects readily. Whenever it took the insect, it
daintily ate up the abdomen and thorax, rejecting
the head, wings, and legs. But my second bat
entirely refused insects of any kind, and would eat
nothing but raw beef cut up into very small morsels.
I never had a pet so difficult to feed.</p>

<p>If the meat were not perfectly fresh, or if it were
not cut small enough, the bat would hardly look at
it. Now if a bit of raw meat about the size of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
large pin’s head be placed in the air, a few minutes
will dry and harden its exterior; and when this was
the case, my bat did not even notice it. So I had to
make twenty or more attempts daily before the creature
would condescend to take any food.</p>

<p>When, however, it <em>did</em> eat, its mode of so doing
was remarkable enough. It seized the meat with a
sharp snap, retreated to the middle of the cage, sat
upright&mdash;as in the engraving already alluded to&mdash;thrust
its wings forward to form a kind of tent, and
then, lowering its head under its wings, disposed of
the meat unseen.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="150" height="80" alt="" />
</div>

<p>From the movement of the neck and upper portion
of the head, it would be seen that the creature ate the
meat much after the manner of a
cat; that is, by a series of snaps or
pecks; for the teeth are all sharply
pointed, and have no power of
grinding the food. These teeth
can be seen in the accompanying sketch of a bat’s
skull.</p>

<p>In many parts of England the bats are called
“Flitter-mice,” and are thought to be simply mice
plus wings. This opinion has been formed from the
resemblance between the general shape, and especially
that of the fur, of the two animals. But if we
look at the teeth, we find at once that those of the
bat are sharp and pointed, extending tolerably
equally all round the jaw-bone; while the teeth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the mice are of that chisel-shaped character found in
the rabbit and other rodent animals.</p>

<p>Now if we turn to the fur, and examine it with a
microscope, we shall there find characteristics as
decided as those of the teeth.</p>

<p>On this page is the magnified image of a single
hair, taken from the long-eared bat. It will be
seen that the outline of the hair is deeply cut, and
the markings run in a double line. These markings
and outlines are caused by the structure of the hair,
which is covered with a regular series of scales
adhering but loosely to its exterior. These scales
can be removed by rough handling, and therefore the
aspect of the hair can be much altered.</p>

</div>

<p>Let us now take a hair from the common mouse,
and place it under the microscope. This being done,
we find the result to be as shown in the accompanying
cut.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="250" height="115" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The two objects here shown are two portions of
the same hair; the upper one showing the middle
of the hair, and the lower being taken from a portion
nearer the root. Both these specimens were taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
by myself from the animals, and drawn by myself
by means of the Camera Lucida, so that they are to
be depended on.</p>

<p>To return to my caged bat.</p>

<p>Although it did not do much in the eating way, it
frequently came to the water vessel and drank therefrom;
but it was so timid when drinking, that I
could not see whether it lapped or drank. When
disturbed, it used to scuttle away over the floor, in a
most absurd manner, but with some speed. Sometimes
it tried to drink by crawling to a spot just over
the vessel, and lowering itself until its nose was
within reach of the water; but the distance was too
great for the attempt to be successful. In its wild
state, the bat hunts insects, as they hover over the
surface of water, and drinks as it flies, by dipping its
head in the water while on the wing.</p>

<p>I rather think that my bat must have received
some injury from the brooms and caps that were
aimed at it when it entered the shop, for it only
lived a fortnight or so, and one morning I found it
hanging by its hind claws from the roof of the cage,
quite dead.</p>

<p>I believe that bats generally die while thus suspended,
for it is a very common thing to find plenty
of suspended bats, dry and mummified, when entrance
is made into an unfrequented cave, or a hollow
tree cut down, or, indeed, when any bat-haunted spot
is examined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>In speaking of the bat, I have used popular terms,
and therefore have employed the word “wing”.
But the apparatus of the bat is not a wing at all, but
only a developed hand. Let the reader spread his
hand as wide as he can, and he will see that between
each finger, and especially between the forefinger
and the thumb, the skin forms a kind of webbing,
something of the same kind as that on the feet of
ducks and other aquatic birds.</p>

<p>Now if the bones of the fingers were drawn out
like wire until they became some seven or eight feet
long, and the skin between them were extended to
the nails of the elongated fingers, we should have a
structure analogous to that of the bat’s wing. The
thumb joint is left comparatively free; and by means
of this joint, and the hooked claw at its extremity,
the creature walks on a level surface, or can crawl
suspended from a beam or a trunk. It is very curious
to see the bat stretching out its wings and feeling
about for a convenient spot whereon to fix the
hooks.</p>

<p>So tenacious are these hooks, that the baby bat is
often found enjoying an airing by clinging to the
body of its mother, and holding firm, while she flies
in search of prey.</p>

<p>It is true that the little creature is suspended with
its head downwards; but it appears quite comfortable,
nevertheless. Bat-children do not suffer from
determination of the blood to the brain. Neither do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
certain human children, it seems, if we are to take
as a criterion those whom we see hanging half out of
perambulators, fast asleep, and rolling from side to
side with every movement of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Both my bats were very particular, not to say
finicking, about their personal appearance. They
bestowed much time and pains on the combing of
their fur, and specially seemed to value a straight
parting down the back.</p>

<p>It was most interesting to watch the little thing
parting its hair. The claw was drawn in a line
straight from the top of the head to the very tail, and
the fur parted at each side with a dexterity worthy
of an accomplished lady’s-maid. The same habit
has been observed in other bats that have been
tamed.</p>

<p>There are more than twenty British bats, but the
habits of all are very similar; and so I prefer to take
the prettiest, and, having described it, to leave the
remaining species for a future occasion.</p>

<p>Pass we now from the Flitter-mouse to the Mouse.</p>

<p>In the fields, in the farm-yards, in the barns, and
in the ricks are to be found myriads of certain little
animals called Field-mice. Acting on the principle
that I have just laid down, I shall take the most
common and I think the prettiest species&mdash;the Common
Short-tailed Field-mouse, represented on next
page.</p>

<p>The fur of this creature is strongly tinged with red,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and by its colour alone it is easily to be distinguished
from the common grey or brown mouse. Its tail is
short and stumpy, looking as if it had suffered amputation
at an early period of life, and its nose is more
rounded than that of the common mouse. Indeed,
it has a very bluff and farmer-like aspect, and looks
as if it ought to wear top-boots.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="300" height="275" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SHORT-TAILED FIELD-MOUSE.</p>
</div>

<p>Common as these little creatures are, they are
seldom seen, because they keep themselves so close
to the ground, and assimilate so nearly with it in
colour, that they cannot easily be descried among the
grass stalks, under shelter of which they pursue their
noiseless way.</p>

<p>Their speed is not nearly so great as that of the
house-mice, but they are much more difficult to
catch; for they wind among the grass so lithely, and
press upon the earth so closely, that the fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
cannot readily close on them, even when they are
discovered.</p>

<p>From this facility of avoiding observation and
capture, they seem to derive much audacity, and
run about a field in fear of nothing but the kestrel.</p>

<p>When first I made a personal acquaintance with
these creatures, it was under rather peculiar circumstances.
There is a certain field, which was given
up to football, cricket, hockey, and similar games,
as soon as the grass was converted into hay and
removed. One day I was very tired with running,
and lay down to rest on a pile of coats that had been
laid aside; my eyes were fixed on one spot of earth,
just visible between the grass stalks, but without
any particular object. Presently I thought I saw a
something red glide across the spot, but was not
certain. However, I leaned over the place and a
little farther on saw the same thing again. So I
made a sharp pounce at the object, and found that
I had caught a short-tailed field-mouse.</p>

<p>Now here was this impertinent little animal taking
a walk close to the wicket, in spite of the bats,
ball, and runners. In order to watch its proceedings,
I released it, and followed it in its progress.
After watching for a few minutes, I happened to
look up for a moment; and when I again looked for
the creature, it was gone, and I could not find it
again.</p>

<p>Subsequently I became sufficiently expert to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
them whenever I wished; and if I wanted a field-mouse,
seldom had to examine more than a square
yard of ground without finding one.</p>

<p>They are very injurious little creatures, for they
are not content with eating corn, but nibble the
young shoots of various plants, and sometimes strip
young trees of their bark.</p>

<p>Fortunately we have allies in air and on earth, in
the persons of owls and kestrels, stoats and weasels,
or the damage done by these red-skinned marauders
would be more than serious.</p>

<p>Some idea of the damage that may be done by the
aggregate numbers of these small quadrupeds may
be formed from the fact that in Dean Forest and
the New Forest great numbers of holly plants were
entirely destroyed by them, they having eaten off
the bark for a distance of several inches from the
ground. And other trees were favoured with the
notice of the field-mouse, but in a different mode.
Great numbers of oak and chestnuts were found dead,
and pulled up; and when pulled up, it was seen that
their roots had been gnawed through, about two
inches below the level of the ground.</p>

<p>Various modes of destroying the marauders were
put in practice, such as traps, poison, &amp;c., but the
most effectual was, as effectual things generally are,
the most simple.</p>

<p>A great number of holes were dug in the ground,
about two feet long, eighteen inches wide, and eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
inches deep. This is the measurement at the
bottom of the hole; but at the top the hole was
only eighteen inches long and nine wide, so that
when mice fell into it, they were unable to escape.</p>

<p>In these holes upwards of forty thousand mice
were taken in less than three months, irrespective of
those that were removed from the holes by the stoats,
weasels, crows, magpies, owls, and other creatures.</p>

<p>Like most of the mouse family, the field-mouse is
easily tamed; and I have seen one that would come
to the side of its cage, and take a grain of com from
its owner’s fingers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HARVEST-MOUSE.</p>
</div>

<p>There is another kind of mouse which may be
found in the autumn, together with its most curious
nest. This is the Harvest-mouse, the tiniest of
British quadrupeds, two harvest-mice being hardly
equal in weight to a halfpenny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief point of interest in this little creature
is its nest, which is not unfrequently found by
mowers and haymakers when they choose to exert
their eyes.</p>

<p>One of these nests, that was brought to me by a
mower, was about the size of a cricket ball, and
almost as spherical. It was composed of dried
grass-stems, interwoven with each other in a manner
equally ingenious and perplexing. It was hollow,
without even a vestige of an entrance; and the substance
was so thin that every object would be visible
through the walls. How it was made to retain its
spherical form, and how the mice were to find
ingress and egress, I could not even imagine. The
nest was fastened to two strong and coarse stems of
grass that had grown near a ditch, and had overgrown
themselves in consequence of a superabundance
of nourishment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus7.jpg" width="300" height="160" alt="" />
<p class="caption">WATER-RAT.</p>
</div>

<p>If we walk along the bank of a stream or a pond,
we shall probably hear a splash, and looking in its
direction, may see a creature diving or swimming,
which creature we call a Water-rat; to the title of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Rat, however, it has but little right, and ought
properly to be called the “Water-vole”.</p>

<p>On examining the banks we shall find the entrance
to its domicile, being a hole in the earth, just above
the water, and generally, where possible, made just
under a root or a large stone. Sometimes the hole
is made at some height above the water, and then it
often happens that the kingfisher takes possession,
and there makes its home. Whether it ejects the
rat or not I cannot say, but I should think that it is
quite capable of doing so. Many a time I have seen
the entrance to a rat-hole decorated with a few stray
fish-bones, which the rustics told me were the relics
of fish brought there and eaten by the water-rat.
But I soon found out that fish-bones were a sign
of kingfishers, and not of rats; and so guided,
found plenty of the beautiful eggs of this beautiful
bird. Excepting the eggs of swallows and martins,
I hardly know any so delicately beautiful as those
of the kingfisher, with their slight rose tint and
semi-transparent shell. But, alas! when the interior
of the egg is removed, the pearly pinkiness
vanishes, and the shell becomes of a pure white,
very pretty, but not containing a tithe of its former
beauty.</p>

<p>The piscatorial propensities of the kingfisher are
not the only cause of the slanderous reports concerning
the water-vole, and its crime of killing and
eating fish. The common house-rat often frequents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the water-side; and, it being a great flesh-eater,
certainly does catch and eat the fish.</p>

<p>But the water-rat is a vegetable feeder, and I believe
almost, if not entirely, a vegetarian in diet.
That it is so in individual cases, at all events, I can
personally testify, having seen the creature engaged
in eating.</p>

<p>In former days, when I thought the water-rats ate
fish, I waged war against them, for which warfare
there are great facilities at Oxford. However, a
circumstance occurred which showed me that I had
been wrong.</p>

<p>I saw a water-rat sitting on a kind of raft that
had formed from a bundle of reeds which had been
cut and were floating down the river. Seeing it
busily at work feeding, I took it for granted that it
was eating a captured fish, and shot it accordingly,
stretching it dead on its reed raft.</p>

<p>On rowing up to the spot, I was rather surprised
to find that there was no fish there; and on examining
the reeds, I rather wondered at the regular grooves
cut by my shot. But a closer inspection revealed a
very different state of things; namely, that the poor
dead rat was quite innocent of fish eating, and had
been gnawing the green bark from the reeds, the
grooves being the marks left by its teeth. After this
I gave up rat shooting on principle.</p>

<p>Once, though, a rather curious circumstance occurred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>In my possession was a pet pistol, which would
throw a ball with great accuracy, and I considered
myself sure of an apple at sixteen paces. One day,
just as I was standing by a branch of the river
Cherwell, I saw a water-rat sitting on the root of a
tree at the opposite side of the river, and watching
me closely. The river was not above twelve or fourteen
yards wide; and the rat presented so good a mark
that I fired at him, and, of course, expected to see him
on his back.</p>

<p>But there sat the rat, quite still on the stump, and
about two inches below him the round hole where
the bullet had struck.</p>

<p>As the creature seemed determined to stay there,
I reloaded, and took a good aim, determined to make
sure of him. As the smoke cleared away, I had the
satisfaction of seeing the rat in exactly the same
position, and another bullet-hole close by the former.
Four shots I made at that provoking animal, and
four bullets did I deposit just under him. As I was
reloading for a fifth shot, the rat walked calmly
down the stump, slid into the water, and departed.</p>

<p>Now, whether he acted from sheer impertinence,
or whether he was stunned by the violent blow beneath
him, I cannot say. The latter may perhaps
be the case, for squirrels are killed in North America
by the shock of the bullet against the bough on which
they sit, so that no hole is made in their skins, and
the fur receives no damage. Perhaps the rat was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
actuated by a supreme contempt for me and my
shooting powers; and, as the result showed, was
quite justified in his opinion.</p>

<p>SHREW-MOUSE&mdash;DERIVATION OF ITS NAME&mdash;SHREW-ASH&mdash;THE
SPIRIT AND THE LIFE&mdash;WATER-SHREW&mdash;ITS HABITS&mdash;THE
MOLE&mdash;MOLE-HILL&mdash;A PET MOLE&mdash;THE WEASEL.</p>

</div>

<p>I have already mentioned that the water-rat has
little claim to the title of rat; and there is another
creature which has even less claim to the title of
mouse. This is the Shrew, or Shrew-mouse as it is
generally called. This creature bears a very close
relationship to the hedgehog, and is a distant connection
of the mole; but with the mouse it has
nothing to do.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus8.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SHREW-MOUSE.</p>
</div>

<p>Numbers of the shrews may be found towards the
end of the autumn lying dead on the ground, from
some cause at present not perfectly ascertained. If
one of these dead shrews be taken, and its little
mouth opened, an array of sharply-pointed teeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
will be seen, something like those of the mole, very
like those of the hedgehog; but not at all resembling
those of the mouse.</p>

<p>The shrew is an insect and worm-devouring creature,
for which purpose its jaws, teeth, and whole
structure are framed. A rather powerful scent is
diffused from the shrew; and probably on that account
cats will not eat a shrew, though they will kill
it eagerly.</p>

<p>On examining Webster’s Dictionary for the meaning
of the word “shrew,” we find three things.</p>

<p>Firstly, that it signifies “a peevish, brawling, turbulent,
vexatious woman”.</p>

<p>Secondly, that it signifies “a shrew-mouse”.</p>

<p>Thirdly, that it is derived from a Saxon word,
“<em>screawa</em>,” a combination of letters which defies
any attempt at pronunciation, except perhaps by a
Russian or a Welshman.</p>

<p>Now, it may be a matter of wonder that the same
word should be used to represent the very unpleasant
female above-mentioned, and also such a pretty,
harmless little creature as the shrew. The reason is
shortly as follows.</p>

<p>In days not long gone by, the shrew was considered
a most poisonous creature, as may be seen in the
works of many authors. In the time of Katherine&mdash;the
shrew most celebrated of all shrews&mdash;any
cow or horse that was attacked with cramp, or indeed
with any sudden disease, was supposed to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
suffered in consequence of a shrew running over the
injured part. In those days homœopathic remedies
were generally resorted to; and nothing but a shrew-infected
plant could cure a shrew-infected animal.
And the shrew-ash, as the remedial plant was called,
was prepared in the following manner.</p>

<p>In the stem of an ash-tree a hole was bored;
into the hole a poor shrew was thrust alive, and the
orifice immediately closed with a wooden plug. The
animal strength of the shrew passed by absorption
into the substance of the tree, which ever after cured
shrew-struck animals by the touch of a leafy branch.</p>

<p>The poor creature that was imprisoned, Ariel-like,
in the tree, was, fortunately for itself, not gifted with
Ariel’s powers of life; and the orifice of the hole
being closed by the plug, we may hope that its
sufferings were not long, and that it perished immediately
for want of air. Still, our fathers were terribly
and deliberately cruel; and if the shrew’s death
was a merciful one, no credit is due to the authors
of it.</p>

<p>For on looking through a curious work on natural
history, of the date of 1658, where each animal is
treated of medicinally, I find recipes of such terrible
cruelty that I refrain from giving them, simply out
of tenderness for the feelings of my reader. Torture
seems to be a necessary medium of healing; and if a
man suffers from “the black and melancholy cholic,”
or “any pain and grief in the winde-pipe or throat,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
he can only be eased therefrom by medicines prepared
from some wretched animal in modes too
horrid to narrate, or even to think of.</p>

<p>We are not quite so bad at the present day; but
still no one with moderate feelings of compassion
can pass through our streets without being greatly
shocked at the wanton cruelties practised by human
beings on those creatures that were intended for
their use, but not as mere machines. Charitably,
we may hope that such persons act from thoughtlessness,
and not from deliberate cruelty; for it does
really seem a new idea to many people that the
inferior animals have any feelings at all.</p>

<p>When a horse does not go fast enough to please
the driver, he flogs it on the same principle that he
would turn on steam to a locomotive engine, thinking
about as much of the feelings of one as of the
other.</p>

<p>Much of the present heedlessness respecting
animals is caused by the popular idea that they have
no souls, and that when they die they entirely
perish. Whence came that most preposterous idea?
Surely not from the only source where we might
expect to learn about souls&mdash;not from the Bible; for
there we distinctly read of “the spirit of the sons of
man”; and immediately afterwards of “the spirit
of the beast,” one aspiring, and the other not so.
And the necessary consequence of the spirit is a life
after the death of the body. Let any one wait in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
frequented thoroughfare for only one short hour, and
watch the sufferings of the poor brutes that pass by.
Then, unless he denies the Divine Providence, he
will see clearly that unless these poor creatures were
compensated in another life, there is no such quality
as justice.</p>

<p>It is owing to sayings such as these, that men
come to deny an all-ruling Providence, and so become
infidels. They don’t examine the Scriptures
for themselves, but take for granted the assertions
of those who assume to have done so, and seeing the
falsity of the assertion, naturally deduce therefrom
the falsity of its source. If a man brings me a cup
of putrid water, I naturally conclude that the source
is putrid too. And when a man hears horrible and
cruel doctrines, which are asserted by theologians to
be the religion of the Scriptures, it is no wonder
that he turns with disgust from such a religion, and
tries to find rest in infidelity. In such a case, where
is the fault?</p>

<p>All created things in which there is life, <em>must</em> live
for ever. There is only one life, and all living things
only live as being recipients; so that as that life is
immortality, all its recipients are immortal.</p>

<p>If people only knew how much better an animal
will work when kindly treated, they would act kindly
towards it, even from so low a motive. And it is so
easy to lead these animals by kindness, which will
often induce an obstinate creature to obey where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
whip would only confirm it in its obstinacy. All
cruelty is simply diabolical, and can in no way be
justified.</p>

<p>Supposing that the two cases could be reversed
for just one hour, what a wonderful change there
would be in the opinion of men; for it may be
assumed that the person most given to inflicting
pain and suffering is the least tolerant of it himself.</p>

<p>There is, perhaps, hardly one of my readers who
does not know some one person who finds an exquisite
delight in hurting the feelings of others by
various means, such as ridicule, practical jokes, ill-natured
sayings, and so on. If so, he will be tolerably
certain to find that the same person is especially
thin-skinned himself, and resents the least approach
to a joke of which he is the subject.</p>

<p>So, if the shrew were to be the afflicted individual,
and the human the victim, there would be found no
one so averse to the medicinal process as he who
had formerly resorted to it under different circumstances.</p>

<p>This principle is finely carried out, in the terrible
scene of Dennis, the executioner’s, last hours in
<cite>Barnaby Rudge</cite>.</p>

<p>These are not pleasant subjects; and we will pass
on to another shrew that is generally found in the
water, and called from thence the Water-shrew. It
is a creature that may be found in many running
streams, if the eyes are sharp enough to observe it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and is well worth examination. As it dives and
runs along the bottom of the stream, it appears to
be studded with tiny silver beads, or glittering
pearls, on account of the air-bubbles that adhere to
its fur. I have seen a whole colony of them disporting
themselves in a little brooklet not two feet
wide, and so had a good opportunity of inspecting
them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus9.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="" />
<p class="caption">WATER-SHREW.</p>
</div>

<p>I may mention here, as has been done in one or
two other works, that nothing is easier than to
watch animals or birds in their state of liberty. All
that is required is perfect quiet. If an observer just
sits down at the foot of a tree, and does not move,
the most timid creatures will come within a few
yards as freely as if no human being were within a
mile. If he can shroud himself in branches or grass
or fern, so much the better; but quiet is the chief
essential.</p>

<p>It is impossible to form an idea of the real beauty
of animal life, without seeing it displayed in a free
and unconstrained state; and more real knowledge
of natural history will be gained in a single summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
spent in personal examination, than by years of book
study.</p>

<p>The characters of creatures come out so strongly;
they have such quaint, comical, little ways with them;
such assumptions of dignity and sudden lowering of
the same; such clever little cheateries; such funny
flirtations and coquetries, that I have many a time
forgotten myself, and burst into a laugh that scattered
my little friends for the next half-hour. It is
far better than a play, and one gets the fresh air
besides.</p>

<p>These little water-shrews are most active in their
sports and their work, for which latter purpose they
make regular paths along the banks. And as to
their sport, they chase one another in and out of the
water, making as great a splash as possible, whisk
round roots, dodge behind stones, and act altogether
just like a set of boys let loose from the school-room.
And then&mdash;what a revulsion of feeling to see a
stuffed water-shrew in a glass-case!</p>

<p>Now for a few words respecting the distant relation
of the shrews, namely, the mole. Of its near
relation, the hedgehog, there will not be time to
speak.</p>

<p>Every one is familiar with the little heaps of earth
thrown up by the mole, and called mole-hills. But
as the animal itself lives almost entirely underground,
comparatively little is known of it; at all
events, to the generality of those who see the hills.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
The mole is not often seen alive; and few who see
it suspended among the branches by the professional
killer would form any conception of the real character
of this subterranean animal.</p>

<p>Meek and quiet as the mole looks, it is one of the
fiercest, if not the very fiercest of animals; it
labours, eats, fights, and loves as if animated by one
of the furies, or rather by all of them together.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<p class="caption">MOLE.</p>
</div>

<p>Intervals of profound rest alternate with savage
action; and according to the accounts of country
folks near Oxford, it works and rests at regular intervals
of three hours each.</p>

<p>Useful as these creatures are as subsoil drain-makers,
they sometimes increase to an inconvenient
extent, and then the professed mole-catcher comes
into practice, and destroys the moles with an apparatus
apparently inadequate to such a purpose. But
the mole is easily killed, and pressure he cannot survive;
so the traps are formed for the purpose of
squeezing the mole, not of smashing or strangling
him.</p>

<p>The mole-catchers are in the habit of suspending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
their victims on branches, mostly of the willow or
similar trees; but their object I could never make
out, nor could they give me any reason, except that
it was the custom.</p>

<p>When a mole is taken out of the ground, very little
earth clings to it. There is always some on its great
digging claws; but very little indeed on its fur, which
is beautifully formed to prevent such accumulation.
The fur of most animals “sets” in some definite direction,
according to its position on the body; but
that of the mole has no particular set, and is fixed
almost perpendicularly on the creature’s skin, much
like the pile of velvet. Indeed the mole’s fur has
much the feel of silk-velvet; and so the title of the
“Little gentleman in the velvet coat” is justly applied.</p>

<p>Those small heaps of earth that are so common in
the fields, and called mole-hills, are merely the result
of the mole’s travelling in search of the earth-worms,
on which it principally feeds; and in their
structure there is nothing remarkable.</p>

<p>But the great mole-hill, or mole-palace, in which
the animal makes its residence, is a very different
affair, and complicated in its structure. In it is
found a central chamber in which the mole resides;
and round this chamber there run galleries or corridors
in a regular series, so as to form a kind of labyrinth, by
means of which the creature may make its escape, if
threatened with danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The accompanying cut shows a section of the
mole-palace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="300" height="120" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MOLE-HILL.</p>
</div>

<p>This palace is formed, if possible, under the protection
of large stones, roots of trees, thick bushes,
or some such situation; and is located as far as possible
from paths or roads.</p>

<p>The food of the mole mostly consists of earth-worms,
in search of which it drives these tunnels
with such assiduity. The depth of the tunnel is necessarily
regulated by the position of the worms; so
that in warm pleasant days or evenings the run, as
it is called, is within a few inches of the surface;
but in winter the worms retire deeply into the unfrozen
soil, and thither the mole must follow them.
For this purpose it sinks perpendicular shafts, and
from thence drives horizontal tunnels. It may be
seen how useful this provision is when one thinks of
the work that is done by the mole when providing
for its own sustenance.</p>

<p>In the cold months, it drives deeply into the
ground, thereby draining it, and preventing the roots
of plants from becoming sodden by the retention of
water above; and the earth is brought from below,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
where it was useless, and, with all its properties inexhausted
by crops, is laid on the surface, there to
be frozen, the particles to be forced asunder by
the icy particles with which it is filled, and, after
the thaw, to be vivified by the oxygen of the
atmosphere, and made ready for the reception of
seeds.</p>

<p>The worms have a mission of a similar nature;
but their tunnels are smaller, and so are their hills.
Every floriculturist knows how useful for certain
plants are the little heaps of earth left by the worms
at the entrance of their holes. And by the united
exertions of moles and worms a new surface is made
to the earth, even without the intervention of human
labour.</p>

<p>Among other pets, I have had a mole&mdash;rather a
strange pet, one may say; but I rather incline to
pets, and have numbered among them creatures
that are not generally petted&mdash;snakes, to wit&mdash;but
which are very interesting creatures, notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Being very desirous of watching the mole in its
living state, I directed a professional catcher to procure
one alive, if possible; and after a while the
animal was produced. At first there was some
difficulty in finding a proper place in which to keep
a creature so fond of digging; but the difficulty was
surmounted by procuring a tub, and filling it half
full of earth.</p>

<p>In this tub the mole was placed, and instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
sank below the surface of the earth. It was fed by
placing large quantities of earth-worms or grubs in
the cask; and the number of worms that this single
mole devoured was quite surprising.</p>

<p>As far as regards actual inspection, this arrangement
was useless; for the mole never would show
itself, and when it was wanted for observation, it
had to be dug up. But many opportunities for
investigating its manners were afforded by taking it
from its tub, and letting it run on a hard surface,
such as a gravel-walk.</p>

<p>There it used to run with some speed, continually
grubbing with its long and powerful snout, trying to
discover a spot sufficiently soft for a tunnel. More
than once it did succeed in partially burying itself,
and had to be dragged out again, at the risk of
personal damage. At last it contrived to slip over
the side of the gravel-walk, and, finding a patch of
soft mould, sank with a rapidity that seemed the
effect of magic. Spades were put in requisition;
but a mole is more than a match for a spade, and
the pet mole was never seen more.</p>

<p>I was by no means pleased at the escape of my
prisoner; but there was one person more displeased
than myself&mdash;namely, the gardener: for he, seeing
in the far perspective of the future a mole running
wild in the garden, disfiguring his lawn and destroying
his seed-beds, was extremely exasperated, and
could by no blandishments be pacified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>However, his fears and anxieties were all in vain,
as is often the case with such matters, and a mole-heap
was never seen in the garden. We therefore
concluded that the creature must have burrowed
under the garden wall, and so have got away.</p>

<p>Sometimes the fur of the mole takes other tints
besides that greyish black that is worn by most
moles. There are varieties where the fur is of an
orange colour; and I have in my own possession a
skin of a light cream colour.</p>

<p>A perpetual thirst seems to be on the mole, for it
never chooses a locality at any great distance from
water; and should the season turn out too dry, and
the necessary supply of water be thus diminished or
cut off, the mole counteracts the drought by digging
wells, until it comes to a depth at which water is
found.</p>

<p>I should like to say something of the Hedgehog,
the Stoat, and other wild animals; but I must only
take one more example of the British Mammalia,
the common Weasel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus12.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="" />
<p class="caption">WEASEL.</p>
</div>

<p>Gifted with a lithe and almost snake-like body, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
long and yet powerful neck, and with a set of sharp
teeth, this little quadruped attacks and destroys
animals which are as superior to itself in size as an
elephant to a dog.</p>

<p>Small men are generally the most pugnacious, and
the same circumstance is noted of small animals.
The weasel, although sufficiently discreet when discretion
will serve its purpose, is ever ready to lay
down that part of valour, and take up the other.</p>

<p>Many instances are known of attacks on man by
weasels, and in every case they proved to be dangerous
enemies. They can spring to a great distance,
they can climb almost anything, and are as active as&mdash;weasels;
for there is hardly any other animal so
active: their audacity is irrepressible, and their bite
is fierce and deep. So, when five or six weasels unite
in one attack, it may be imagined that their opponent
has no trifling combat before him ere he can claim
the victory. In such attacks, they invariably direct
their efforts to the throat, whether their antagonist
be man or beast.</p>

<p>They feed upon various animals, chiefly those of
the smaller sort, and especially affect mice; so that
they do much service to the farmer. There is no
benefit without its drawbacks; and in this case, the
benefits which the weasel confers on farmers by
mouse-eating is counterbalanced, in some degree, by
a practice on the part of the weasel of varying its
mouse diet by an occasional chicken, duckling, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
young pheasant. Perhaps to the destruction of the
latter creature the farmer would have no great
objection.</p>

<p>The weasel is a notable hunter, using eyes and
nose in the pursuit of its game, which it tracks
through every winding, and which it seldom fails to
secure. Should it lose the scent, it quarters the
ground like a well-trained dog, and occasionally aids
itself by sitting upright.</p>

<p>Very impertinent looks has the weasel when it
thus sits up, and it has a way of crossing its fore-paws
over its nose that is almost insulting. At least
I thought so on one occasion, when I was out with
a gun, ready to shoot anything&mdash;more shame to me!
There was a stir at the bottom of a hedge, some
thirty yards distant, and catching a glimpse of some
reddish animal glancing among the leaves, I straightway
fired at it.</p>

<p>Out ran a weasel, and, instead of trying to hide,
went into the very middle of a footpath on which I
was walking, sat upright, crossed its paws over its
nose, and contemplated me steadily. It was a most
humiliating affair.</p>

<p>The weasel has been tamed, and, strange to say,
was found to be a delightful little animal in every
way but one. The single exception was the evil
odour which exudes from the weasel tribe in general,
and which advances from merely being unpleasant,
as in our English weasels, to the quintessence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
stenches as exhibited by the Skunk and the Teledu.
A single individual of the latter species has been
known to infect a whole village, and even to cause
fainting in some persons; and the scent of the former
is so powerful, that it almost instantaneously tainted
the provisions that were in the vicinity, and they
were all thrown away.</p>

<p>The Polecat, Ferret, Marten, and Stoat belong to
the true weasels; the Otters and Gluttons claiming
a near relationship.</p>

</div>

<p>I have already said that the birds must be entirely
passed over in this little work; and therefore we
make a jump down two steps at once, and come upon
the Reptiles, of whom are many British examples.</p>

<p>The first reptile of which we shall treat is the
common little Lizard that is found in profusion on
heaths, or, indeed, on most uncultivated grounds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus13.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE COMMON LIZARD.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>It is an agile and very pretty little creature, darting
about among the grass and heather, and twisting
about with such quickness that its capture is not always
easy. Sunny banks and sunny days are its
delight; and any one who wishes to see this elegant
little reptile need only visit such a locality, and then
he will run little risk of disappointment.</p>

<p>There is one peculiarity about it that is rather
startling. If suddenly seized, it snaps off its tail,
breaking it as if it were a stick of sealing wax, or a
glass rod. Several lizards possess this curious faculty,
and of one of them we shall presently treat.</p>

<p>The food of this lizard is composed of insects,
which it catches with great agility as they settle on
the leaves or the ground. If captured without injury&mdash;a
feat that cannot always be accomplished, on
account of the fragility of its tail&mdash;it can be kept in
a fern case, and has a very pretty effect there.</p>

<p>One of the chief beauties of this animal is its
brilliant eye; and this feature will be found equally
beautiful in many of the reptiles, and especially in
that generally-hated one, the toad.</p>

<p>In the winter-time the lizard is not seen; for it is
lying fast asleep in a snug burrow under the roots of
any favourable shrub, and does not show itself until
the warm beams of the sun call it from its retreat.</p>

<p>The next British lizard that I shall mention is one
that is generally considered as a snake, and a
poisonous one; both ideas being equally false. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
popularly known by the name of the Blind-worm,
or Slow-worm; and is not a snake at all, but a lizard
of the Skink tribe, without any legs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus14.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BLIND-WORM.</p>
</div>

<p>The scientific name for it is <i>Anguis fragilis</i>; and
it is called fragile on account of its custom of snapping
itself in two, when struck.</p>

<p>Only very lately, I saw an example of this strange
propensity, and was the cause of it. Near Dover,
there is a small wood, where vipers are reported to
dwell; and as I was walking in the wood, I caught
a glimpse of a snake-like body close by my foot. I
struck, or rather stabbed, it with a little stick&mdash;for
it had a very viperine look about it&mdash;and with success
rather remarkable, for the very slight blow that
the creature could have received from so insignificant
a weapon, used in such a manner. The viper was
clearly cut into two parts, but how or where could
not be seen, owing to the thick leaves and grass that
rose nearly knee-high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>On pushing among the leaves, I found with regret
that the creature was only a blind-worm.</p>

<p>A curious performance was being exhibited by the
severed tail, a portion of the animal about five inches
long; this was springing and jumping about with
great liveliness and agility, entirely on its own
account, for by this time the blind-worm itself had
made its escape, and all search was unavailing.</p>

<p>Some ten minutes or so were consumed in looking
for the reptile itself; and by that time the activity
of the tail was at an end, and it was lying flat on the
ground, coiled into a curve of nearly three-fourths of
a circle. I gave it a push with the stick, when I was
startled by the severed member jumping fairly into
the air, and recommencing its dance with as much
vigour as before. This performance lasted for some
minutes, and was again exhibited when the tail was
roused by another touch from the stick. Nearly
half-an-hour elapsed before the touch of the stick
failed to make the tail jump, and even then it produced
sharp convulsive movements.</p>

<p>The object of this strange compound of insensibility
and irritability may perhaps be, that when an
assailant’s attention is occupied by looking at the
tail, the creature itself may quietly make its escape.</p>

<p>The food of the blind-worm is generally of an insect
nature, and it seems to be fond of small slugs. The
country people declare that it is guilty of various
crimes, such as biting cattle and similar offences, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
which bite an old author says that, “unless remedy
be had, there followeth mortality or death, for the
poyson thereof is very strong”.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, we have but one poisonous
reptile, the viper; and the slow-worm is as innocent
of poison as an earthworm. It is true that, if provoked,
it will sometimes bite; but its mouth is so
small, and its teeth so minute, that it cannot even
draw blood.</p>

<p>The names that are given to it are hardly in
accordance with its formation, for it is not very
sluggish in its movements, although it can be easier
taken than the lizard; while it is anything but blind,
and its eyes, though small, are brilliant. Perhaps
the epithets ought to have been applied to the givers,
and not to the receiver.</p>

<p>As for the real snakes, there are but two species in
England, one being called the Viper, or Adder, and
the other the Ringed, or Grass-snake. The Viper is
rather to be avoided, as it is possessed of poison-fangs,
and if irritated, is not slow in using them.</p>

<p>Of this latter I have little to say, and would not
have mentioned it excepting for two reasons: the
one to enable any person to distinguish it from the
common snake, and to avoid, as far as possible, the
chance of being bitten; and the other to tell how to
heal the bite, should so untoward an event happen.</p>

<p>Poisonous snakes may be readily known by the
shape of their head and neck; the head being very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
wide at the back, and the neck comparatively small.
Some persons compare the head of a poisonous snake
to the ace of spades, which comparison, although
rather exaggerated, gives a good idea of the poison-bearing
head. It has a cruel and wicked look about
it also, and one recoils almost instinctively.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus15.jpg" width="350" height="275" alt="" />
<p class="caption">VIPER.</p>
</div>

<p>Should a person be bitten by the viper, the effects
of the poison may be much diminished by the liberal
use of olive oil; and the effect of the oil is said to be
much increased by heat. Strong ammonia, or hartshorn,
as it is popularly called, is also useful, as is the
case with the stings of bees and wasps, and for the
same reason. The evil consequences of the viper’s
bite vary much in different persons, and at different
times, according to the temperament of the individual
or his state of health.</p>

<p>I may as well put in one word of favour for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
viper before it is dismissed. It is not a malignant
creature, nor does it seek after victims; but it is as
timid as any creature in existence, slipping away at
the sound of a footstep, and only using its fangs if
trodden on accidentally, or intentionally assaulted.</p>

<p>The second English snake is the common harmless
Ringed Snake; which does not bite, because it has
no teeth to speak of; and does not poison people,
because it has no venom at all.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus16.jpg" width="300" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption">COMMON SNAKE.</p>
</div>

<p>Its only mode of defence is by pouring forth a most
unpleasant, pungent odour, which adheres to the
hands or clothes so pertinaciously, that many washings
are required before it is expelled. Yet it is
sparing enough even of this solitary weapon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
may, after a while, be handled without any inconvenience.</p>

<p>To this assertion I can bear personal and somewhat
extensive witness; for I have caught and kept numbers
of snakes. The worthy villagers must have
formed curious ideas of me, and I rather fancy must
have accredited me with something of the wizard
character; for I contrived to oppose their prejudices&mdash;all,
by the way, of a cruel character&mdash;in so many
instances, that they were rather afraid, as well as
annoyed. To see them run away, as if from a
lighted shell, when I came among them with a snake
in each hand, was decidedly amusing, and not less
curious was the pertinacity with which they clung
to their prejudices.</p>

<p>In vain were arguments used to prove that the
snake was not a venomous animal, and ought not to
be killed and tortured; in vain did I put my finger
into the snake’s mouth, and let its forked tongue
glide over my very hand or face; they were not to
be so taken in, and they remained wise in their own
conceit.</p>

<p>They certainly could not deny that the snake did
not bite me, and that its tongue did not pierce me,
but the conclusion deduced therefrom was simply
that my constitution, or perchance my magical art,
was such that I was unbitable and unpoisonable.</p>

<p>No! to them the snake was still poisonous, and
its tongue still envenomed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>At one time we had so many snakes that they
were kept in the crevices of an old wall, and left to
stay or go as they pleased. My boys&mdash;I had a school
at that time&mdash;took wonderfully to snake hunting,
and every half-holiday produced a fresh supply of
snakes. The boys used to devise the strangest
amusements in connection with their snakes, of
which they were very proud, each boy exhibiting
his particular favourite, and expatiating on its excellences.</p>

<p>One of their fashions, and one which lasted for
some time, was to make tunnels in the side of the
Wiltshire Downs, and to turn in their snakes at one
end, merely for the purpose of seeing them come out
at the other.</p>

<p>Then there was a stone-quarry some three miles
distant, which was in some parts of the year nearly
filled with water. Thither the boys were accustomed
to repair for the purpose of indulging their snakes
with a bath. They certainly seemed to enjoy the
swim, and were the better for it.</p>

<p>Sometimes there was great excitement; for a
snake would now and then act in too independent a
manner, and instead of swimming straight across, so
as to be caught by a boy on the opposite side, would
sink to the bottom, and there lie flat and immovable.
Long sticks could not be found there; and
their only mode of making the snake stir was to
startle it by throwing stones. Even then there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
a difficulty; for if the stones fell too far from the
snake they had no effect, and if they fell on him they
might hurt him.</p>

<p>To wait until the truant chose to move would
have been hopeless, for snakes are able to take so
much pure air into their lungs, and they require so
little of it for respiration, that the patience of the
boys would be exhausted long before the snake felt a
necessity for moving.</p>

<p>Sometimes a snake would try to get away, and
insinuate his head and part of his body into a crevice;
in that case there was sad anxiety, and judicious
management was required to eliminate the reptile
without damage. It is a very difficult matter to drag
a snake backwards, because the creature sets up the
edges of the scales, and each one serves as a point of
resistance. So, when the snake is within a crevice,
where the scales of the back can act as well as those
of the belly, the difficulty is increased.</p>

<p>When such an event took place, the best mode of
extracting the snake was to let it glide on, and so
lower its scales, and then to pluck it out with a
sudden jerk, before it had time to erect them afresh.
But as often as otherwise, the snake got the better
in the struggle, and by slow degrees was lost to
view.</p>

<p>Perhaps the pleasantest portion of snake-keeping
was the feeding. It was found that the snakes lost
their appetite, and would not eat, though frogs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
newts were liberally supplied. So the boys settled
the matter by opening the mouth of the snake, and
pushing a newt fairly down its throat.</p>

<p>One of the largest snakes that I have seen was
engaged in feeding himself, not trusting to boys for
any help. I was walking in a field, and heard a
strange cry from a neighbouring ditch. On going
towards the spot, I saw there a large snake struggling
with a frog. The frog was comparatively as large as
the snake, and as it had a plain objection to being
swallowed, there was some turmoil.</p>

<p>The snake was stretched along the bottom of the
ditch, which at this time was dry, and he held in his
mouth both hind feet of the frog, who was also
stretched forward at full length, resisting with its
fore-legs the attempts of the snake to draw it back,
and croaking dismally. The strife continued for
some time, when I made a sudden movement, and
the snake, loosing its hold of the frog, glided up the
opposite bank. The frog slowly gathered itself together,
sat still for some little time, and then hopped
away.</p>

<p>The entire empty skin of the snake may often be
found among bushes, where the creature has gone in
order to assist itself in casting off its old skin. Snakes,
as well as other animals, wear out their coats, and
are obliged to change them for others. When the
change is about to take place, and a new coat has
formed under the old, like a new skin under a blister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the creature betakes itself to some spot where is
thick grass, reeds, or similar substances. A rent
then opens in the neck, and the snake, by wriggling
about among the stems, literally crawls out of its
skin, which it leaves behind, turned inside out.
Even the covering of the eyes is cast away, and in
consequence the snake is partially blind for a day or
two previously to the moult, if we may call it so.</p>

<p>Eggs laid by the snake are also of frequent occurrence.
I have found them in manure heaps, the
warmth of which places is attractive to them. The
eggs are white, and covered with a strong membrane,
but have no shell. They are laid in long strings,
from sixteen to twenty eggs being in each chain.</p>

<p>In the winter the ringed snake retires to a convenient
cell, such as a hollow tree, or a heap of
wood, and there it remains in a torpid state until
the warm weather. Many individuals have been
found collected together in these winter quarters,
probably for the sake of affording each other mutual
warmth.</p>

<p>The reptiles of which we have just treated live
exclusively on land, though they may occasionally
be found in water; but those which we shall now
inspect belong rather to the water than to the land.
The most common of these amphibious reptiles, as
they are called, is the Frog.</p>

<p>A very curious animal is a frog, and well worth
examining, as well in its perfect state as in its intermediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
state. To begin at the beginning of a frog’s
existence, we find it exhibited in masses of eggs, fixed
to each other by a kind of gelatinous substance, and
floating in large quantities in ditches or ponds.
Each egg is about the size and shape of a pea, and
in the centre is the little black speck from which the
young frog proceeds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus17.jpg" width="300" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FROG.</p>
</div>

<p>In process of time the egg is hatched, and out
comes a queer little creature, with a big head and a
flat slender tail, called generally a tadpole, and in
some places a pollywog. In this state of life the
young creature is simply a fish, with fish-like bones,
and breathing through gills, after the manner of
fish.</p>

<p>Being very voracious, it grows rapidly: little legs
begin to show themselves; and, at the proper
season, the gills are laid aside, the tail vanishes, and
the little frog is then in its usual form. The circulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of the blood can be well exhibited by means
of a microscope, if a tadpole be laid on the stage so
as to bring its tail within the focus, care being taken
to keep that member well wetted.</p>

<p>At the time when the tail is laid aside, the young
frog is very small, and in this state is generally
found to swarm immediately after rain. The frog-showers,
of which we so often hear, are probably
occasioned, not by the actual descent of frogs from
the clouds, but from the genial influence of the
moisture on the young frogs who have already been
hatched and developed, and who have been biding
their time before they dared to venture abroad.</p>

<p>Still I would not venture to say that frogs have
not descended <em>in</em> the rain, for there are several accredited
accounts of fish-showers, both being probably
caused in the same way.</p>

<p>For a drawing of the Tadpole, see <a href="#Page_85">page 85</a>.</p>

<p>It is not often that frogs are found far from water,
for they are the thirstiest of beings, and drink with
every pore of their body. If, for example, a wrinkled
and emaciated frog is placed in confinement, and
plentifully supplied with water, it absorbs the grateful
moisture like a sponge, and plumps up in a wonderfully
short time.</p>

<p>From the same cause, it parts with its moisture
with equal rapidity; and if a dead frog be laid in the
open air on a dry day it speedily shrinks up, and becomes
hard as horn. The skin and lungs co-operate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
in respiration, but only when the former is moist.
So, in order to secure that object, the frog is furnished
with an internal tank, so to speak, which receives
the superabundance of the absorbed water,
and keeps it pure until it is required for use. So
great is the power of absorption that a frog has been
known to absorb a quantity of water equal to itself
in weight, merely through the pores of the abdominal
surface, and this in a very short time.</p>

<p>In England we don’t eat frogs, for what reason I
know not. One species of frog is very excellent
food, and it is but natural to suppose that another
may be so, <i>i.e.</i>, if properly cooked. However, the old
belief still keeps its ground, that the French are the
natural foes of the English, and we ought to hate
them, because they “eat frogs and are saddled with
wooden shoes”. Still I cannot but think that to eat
frogs is better than to starve or to steal, and that to
wear wooden shoes is not more humiliating than to
wear no shoes at all.</p>

<p>After its fashion, the frog sings, though it is but
after a fashion. We call the frog’s song a croak: I
wonder what name the frog would give to our singing.
When the frog sings, it generally sinks itself
under water, with the exception of its head, opens
its mouth, lays its lower jaw flat on the water, and
sets to work as if it meant to make the best of its
time. Even in England we have fine specimens of
frog concerts, though not to such an extent as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
many other countries. In France the frogs make
such a croaking, that we hardly wonder at the rather
tyrannous conduct of the noblesse just before the
great Revolution. When the nobility or courtiers
spent any time in the country, the miserable peasants
were forced to flog the water all night, on purpose to
keep the frogs quiet, for their croaking was so noisy
that the fastidious senses of the fashionables could
not be lulled to sleep.</p>

<p>Now-a-days, the people don’t seem to be satisfied
with the country croakings, but they import the
horrid sounds into the city by means of a toy called
a “grenouille,” which, when set in motion, makes a
croaking sound just like that of a frog.</p>

<p>As a general fact, frogs are just endurable, and
people will inspect them&mdash;from a distance&mdash;without
much ado. But the case is widely altered when they
see the frog’s first-cousin, the Toad.</p>

<p>A large volume might easily be filled with tales
respecting this much-calumniated creature; in which
tales the toad appears to be a very incarnation of
malignity, and to be wholly formed of poison. If it
burrowed near the root of a tree, every one who ate
a leaf of that tree would die; and, if he only handled
it, would be struck with sudden cramp. And the cause
of this poisonous nature was its liver, which was
“very vitious, and causeth the whole body to be of
an ill temperament”.</p>

<p>Fortunately, toads had two livers; and although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
both of them were corrupted, yet one was full of
poison, and the other resisted poison. As for remedies,
the only effectual one was of rather a complicated
nature, and consisted of plantain, black
hellebore, powdered crabs, the blood of the sea-tortoise
mixed with wine, the stalks of dogs’ tongues,
the powder of the right horn of a hart, cummin, the
vermet of a hare, the quintessence of treacle, and the
oil of a scorpion, mixed and taken <i lang="la">ad libitum</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus18.jpg" width="300" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE COMMON TOAD.</p>
</div>

<p>Even in the days when this prodigious prescription
was invented, some good was acknowledged to exist
in a toad, the one being the precious jewel in its
head, and the other its power as a styptic. Supposing
any one to fall down and knock his nose against
a stone, he could instantly stop the bleeding if he
only had in his pocket a toad that had been pierced
through with a piece of wood and dried in the shade
or smoke. All that was requisite was to hold the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
dried toad in the hand, and the bleeding would immediately
cease. The reason for this effect is, that
“horror and fear constrained the blood to run into
his proper place, for fear of a beast so contrary to
humane nature”.</p>

<p>And, as a concluding instance of the wonderful
things that happened whenever toads were the subject,
we are told that at Darien, where the household
slaves water the door-steps in the evening, all
the drops that fall on the right hand turn into toads.</p>

<p>These poor creatures fare little better even now,
as far as public opinion goes; and in France worse
than in England.</p>

<p>I was once walking in the forest at Meudon with
a party of friends, and was brought to a check by a
sudden attack made on a large toad that was walking
along the pathway. I succeeded in stopping a
blow that was aimed at it; and was stooping down,
intending to remove it to a place of safety, when I
was hastily pulled away, and horror was depicted on
the countenances of all the spectators.</p>

<p>“It will bite you,” cried one.</p>

<p>“Pouah!” exclaimed another, “it will spit poison
at you.”</p>

<p>“In France, every one kills toads,” said a third.</p>

<p>I objected that it could not bite, because it had no
teeth.</p>

<p>“No teeth!” they all exclaimed. “In France,
toads <em>always</em> have teeth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, then,” I said, “I will open its mouth, and
show you that it has none.”</p>

<p>But before I could touch it I was again dragged
away.</p>

<p>“Teeth come when the toads are fifty years old,”
was the explanation that was given; but still the
death-sentence had passed in every mind, and I
knew that when I moved the poor toad would be
killed.</p>

<p>Just then, some one remarked that tobacco killed
toads, if put on their backs. So I took advantage of
the assertion, and made a compromise that, on my
part, I would not handle the toad; and that, on
theirs, the only mode by which they might kill it was
by putting tobacco on it.</p>

<p>The terms being thus arranged, plenty of tobacco
was produced&mdash;and very bad tobacco, too, as is
generally the case in France; and, as no one but
myself dared come so near, I put about half-an-ounce
of the weed on the back of the toad, as it sat
in a rut. For a minute or more, the creature sat
quite still, and all the party began to exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<p>“See! the toad is quite dead!”</p>

<p>“Ah! the nasty animal!”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Ool!&mdash;(no one ever made a better
shot at my name than Ool)&mdash;Monsieur Ool! the
toad is dead!”</p>

<p>However, the toad rose, shook off all the tobacco,
and recommenced his march along the road. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
only good that was done was the saving of that
individual toad’s life, for all the party retained their
faith in toads’ teeth, and probably thought that the
creature would not touch me because I was a trifle
madder than the rest of my nation, who are always
very mad on the French stage.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I found that the belief in toads’ teeth
was quite general; and one person offered to show me
some, half-an-inch in length, which he kept in a box at
home. But I was never fortunate enough to see them.</p>

<p>In England, toads are sometimes valued for the
good which they do; and the market-gardeners,
whose trim grounds surround London, actually
import toads from the country, paying for them a
certain sum per dozen. For toads are voracious creatures,
feeding upon slugs, worms, grubs, and insects
of various kinds, and so devour great numbers of
these little pests to the gardener.</p>

<p>The mode in which a toad catches its prey is
curious enough. Its tongue is fastened into its
mouth in a very peculiar way, the base of the tongue
being fixed at the entrance of the mouth, the tip
pointing down its throat when it is at rest. When,
however, the toad sees an insect or slug within
reach, the tongue is suddenly shot out of the mouth,
and again drawn back, carrying the creature with it.</p>

<p>So rapidly is this operation performed, that the
insect seems to disappear by magic. The frog feeds
in the same manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>For the poisonous properties attributed to the
toad, there is some foundation, though a small one.
But a very small foundation is generally found strong
enough to bear a very large superstructure of
calumny; though the reverse is the case when the
report is a favourable one. The skin of the toad is
covered with small tubercles, which secrete an acid
humour sufficiently sharp and unpleasant to prevent
dogs from carrying a toad in their mouths, though
not so powerful as to deter them from attacking
toads and killing them.</p>

<p>A rather curious advantage has been taken of the
insect-eating propensities of the toad. A gentleman
had killed a toad at a very early hour one morning,
and after skinning it, for the purpose of stuffing the
skin, he dissected its digestive system. The contents
of the stomach he turned out into a basin of
water, and found there a mass of insects, some of
them very rare and in good preservation.</p>

<p>Afterwards, he was accustomed to kill toads for
the express purpose of collecting the insects that
were found within them, and which, being caught
during the night, were often of such species as are
not often found.</p>

<p>The same experiment elicited another curious
fact, namely, the great tenacity of life possessed by
some insects. Before pinning out the insects that
were found, and which were mostly beetles, they
had been allowed to remain in the water for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
days, and were apparently dead. Yet, when they
were pinned on cork, they revived; and, when they
were visited, were found sprawling about in quite a
lively style.</p>

<p>Like all the reptiles, the toad changes its skin,
but the cast envelope is never found, although those
of the serpents are common enough. The reason
why it is not found is this: the toad is an economical
animal, and does not choose that so much
substance should be wasted. So, after the skin has
been entirely thrown off, the toad takes its old coat
in its two fore-paws, and dexterously rolls it, and
pats it, and twists it, until the coat has been formed
into a ball. It is then taken between the paws,
pushed into the mouth, and swallowed at a gulp like
a big pill.</p>

<p>The Newts, or Efts, or Evats, as they are called in
different parts of England, can be easily distinguished
from the lizard by the flattened tail, which, being
intended for swimming, is formed accordingly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus19.jpg" width="300" height="230" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE COMMON NEWT.</p>
</div>

<p>Two species of these creatures are found in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
country, the common Water-Newt and the Smooth
Newt. These beautiful creatures may be found in
almost every piece of still water, from ponds and
ditches up to lakes. The full beauty of the newt is
not seen until the breeding season begins to come
on, and even then only in the male.</p>

<p>At this time the green back and orange belly attain
a brighter tint, and the back is decorated with a wavy
crest, tipped with crimson. This crest is continually
waving from side to side as the creature moves, and
forms graceful curves. The newts are equally at
home in water and on land, and in the latter case
have often been mistaken for lizards.</p>

<p>One of these animals, when taking a walk, alarmed
an acquaintance of mine sadly. He was rather a
tall man than otherwise, and did not appear particularly
timid; but one day he came to me looking
somewhat pale, and announced that he had just
been terribly frightened.</p>

<p>“A fish, with legs!” said he, “<em>four</em> legs! got out
of the water and ran right across the path in front
of me! I saw it run!”</p>

<p>“A fish with legs!” I replied; “there are no such
creatures.”</p>

<p>“Indeed there are, though, for I saw them. It
had <span class="smcapuc">FOUR LEGS</span>, and it waggled its tail! It was
horrible, horrible!”</p>

<p>“It was only a newt,” I replied, “an eft. There
is nothing to be afraid of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was the <em>legs</em>,” said he, shuddering, “those
dreadful legs. I don’t mind getting bitten, or stung,
but I can’t stand legs.”</p>

<p>Newts are very interesting animals, though they
have legs, and can easily be kept in a tank if fed
properly. Little red worms seem to be their
favourite food, and the newt eats them in a rather
peculiar style. I have had numbers of newts of all
sizes and in all stages of their growth, and always
found them eat the worm in the same way. As the
worm sank through the water, the newt would swim
to it, and by a sudden snap seize it in the middle.
For nearly a minute it would remain with the worm
in its mouth, one end protruding from each side of
its jaws. Another snap would then be given, and
after an interval a third, which generally disposed of
the worm.</p>

<p>When they have been swimming freely in a large
pond, I have often seen large newts attack the
smaller, and try to eat them; but I never saw the
attempt successful, though I hear that they have been
seen to devour the younger individuals. They always
came from behind, as if trying to avoid observation,
and then made a sudden dart forward, snapping at
the tail of their intended victim. In confinement I
never saw even an attempt at cannibalism.</p>

<p>Whether it is invariably the case I cannot say,
but every newt that I took cast its skin within a few
hours from the time that it was placed in the glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
jar. The general surface of the skin came off in
flakes, but that from the paws was drawn off like
gloves, retaining on their surface all the markings
and creases which they exhibited when in their
proper place.</p>

<p>How the drawing off of their tiny gloves was
effected I could not see, though I watched carefully.
They looked beautiful as they floated in the water,
being delicate as gossamer, white, and almost transparent.
They might have been made for Queen Mab
herself, and were so delicate that I never could preserve
any of them so as to give a proper idea of their
form.</p>

<p>It may be that the change of water might cause
the change of skin, for the water in which they were
kept was drawn from a pump, and that in which
they formerly lived was the ordinary soft water found
in ponds.</p>

<p>Pretty as is the newt, it is as harmless as pretty,
and notwithstanding has suffered under the reputation
of being a venomous creature. The absurd tales
that I have heard of this creature could scarcely be
believed; and how people with any share of sense
could receive such absurdities is matter of wonder.
And as usual, the moral of the stories is, that newts
are to be killed wherever found. The belief of the
poisonous character of the newt is of long standing,
as may be seen in the ancient works on natural
history. In one of these it is said that its poison is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
like that of vipers; and there is a description of the
formation of its tail which is rather beyond my comprehension:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The tail standeth out betwixt the hinder-legs in
the middle, like the figure of a wheel-whisk, or
rather so contracted as if many of them were conjoined
together, and the void or empty places in the
conjunctions were filled”.</p>

<p>The capture and domesticating of newts gave dire
offence in the village where I lived for some time;
and the expressions used when I took a newt in
my hands were not unlike those of the Parisians respecting
the toad. Sundry ill-omened tales of effets
were told me. For example: A girl of the village
was filling her pitcher at a stream which runs near
the village, when an effet jumped out of the water,
sprang on her arm, bit out a piece of flesh, spat fire
into the wound, and, leaping into the water, escaped.
The girl’s arm instantly swelled to the shoulder, and
the doctor was obliged to cut it off.</p>

<p>This was told me with an immensity of circumstantial
details common to such narrators, and was
corroborated by the bystanders. The wounded lady
herself was not to be found, and cross-questions
elicited that it “weir afoor their time”. I asked
them how the effet which lived in the water, and
had just leaped out of it, was able to keep a fire
alight in its interior; but they were not in the
least shaken, except perhaps in their heads, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
were wagged with a Lord Burleigh kind of emphasis.</p>

<p>Then there was the sexton-clerk-gardener-musician
and general factotum, who had a newt tale of
his own to tell. He had been cutting grass in the
churchyard, and an effet ran at him, and bit him on
the thumb. He chopped off the effet’s head with his
knife, but his thumb was very bad for a week.</p>

<p>Once they got the better of the argument, at all
events in the eyes of the owner of the farming stock,
and my poor newts were ejected. It happened
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Two or three specimens I kept in my own room in
a glass vase, in order to watch them more closely;
and some six or seven others lived as stock in the
large horse-trough, from whence they could be taken
when required.</p>

<p>One day the proprietor came to me and ordered
the destruction of my newts, for they had killed one
of his calves.</p>

<p>“But,” I remonstrated, “they cannot kill a calf
or even a mouse, for they have no fangs and very
little mouths. Besides, the calf has not come near
this trough.”</p>

<p>So saying, I took up several of the newts, opened
their mouths&mdash;no easy matter, by the way&mdash;and
showed that they had no fangs. And I urged, that
even if they had been as poisonous as rattlesnakes,
it would not have made any difference to the calf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
which had never left the cowhouse, and was at the
opposite end of the farm-yard, separated by a barn
and several gates. But all was useless.</p>

<p>“There are the newts, and there is the dead calf!”
was the answer; and so the newts had to go. However,
I would not suffer them to be killed, but put
them into a bag and took them back to the pond
whence they had come.</p>

<p>Afterwards the proprietor said that the calf died
because its mother had drunk at the trough in which
the poisonous newts were.</p>

<p>Now, the funniest part of the story is, that there
was not a horse-pond that did not swarm with efts,
and consequently all the foals and calves ought to
have died. Only they didn’t.</p>

<p>The care which the female newt takes in depositing
her eggs is very remarkable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus20.jpg" width="300" height="180" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE FEMALE NEWT.</p>
</div>

<p>Each egg is taken separately, and by the aid of
the fore-paws is regularly tied or twisted up in the
leaves of dead plants, for which process different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
people have different reasons. Some think that it
is for the purpose of preventing too ready an access
of water, and so to retard their hatching; while some
say that it is to guard the egg against voracious
water-animals. To the latter opinion I rather incline;
perhaps both may be right.</p>

<p>When hatched, the young newt is very like a
tadpole, breathing by gills outside its neck. After
a while the gills vanish and the legs appear; but it
keeps its tail. It is rather curious that the frog tadpole
puts forth its hinder-legs first; while in the
tadpole of the newt, the fore-legs are the first to
show themselves.</p>

<p>After the gills are lost, the newt breathes by means
of lungs; and if it is in the water, is forced to rise at
intervals for the purpose of breathing.</p>

<p>The tenacity with which these creatures cling to
life is quite surprising. Experiments have been tried
purposely to see to what degree a body could be
mutilated, and yet retain life. They have even been
frozen up into a solid block of ice, and, after the
thawing of their cold prison, revived, and seemed
none the worse for it. I may as well mention that
none of these experiments were tried by myself, for
I am not scientific enough to care nothing for the
infliction of pain; but on one occasion I did try an
experiment, and, as it turned out, a very cruel one,
although it was not intended for an experiment.</p>

<p>I was studying the anatomy of the frogs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
newts; and having eight or ten fine specimens of
the latter creature, determined to take advantage of
the opportunity. The first thing was, of course, to
kill the creature without injuring its structure, and I
thought that the best mode of so doing would be to
put it into my poison-bottle. This was a large glass
jar filled with spirits of wine, in which was held
corrosive sublimate in solution. This mixture generally
killed the larger insects almost immediately,
and seemed just the thing for the newts.</p>

<p>So they were put into the jar&mdash;but then there was
a scene which I will not describe, which I trust
never to see again, and of which I do not even like
to think. Suffice it to say, that nearly a quarter of
an hour elapsed before these miserable creatures
died, though in sheer mercy I kept them pressed
below the surface.</p>

<p>Changing our post of observation from the banks
of the ponds to those of the running streams, we
shall find there many creatures worthy of observation;
so many, indeed, that it would be a hopeless
task to attempt to give even a slight account of one-fiftieth
of them. I shall, therefore, only mention
two creatures, as examples of the fish; and these
two are chosen because they are exceedingly common,
and very different from each other in colour and
habits.</p>

<p>The first of these creatures is the common Stickleback,
or Tittlebat, as it is sometimes called. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
are several species of British sticklebacks; but the
commonest, and I think the most beautiful, is the
three-spined stickleback.</p>

<p>These little fish derive their name from the sharp
spines with which they are armed, and which they
can raise or depress at pleasure&mdash;as I know to my
cost. For being, as boys often are, rather silly, I
made a wager that I would swallow a minnow alive;
and having made the bet, proceeded to win it. Unfortunately,
instead of a minnow, a stickleback was
handed to me, which having its spines pressed close
to the body, was very like a minnow. Just as I
swallowed it, the creature stuck up all its spines, and
fixed itself firmly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus21.jpg" width="300" height="275" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE STICKLEBACK.</p>
</div>

<p>Neither way would it go, and the torture was horrid.
At last, a great piece of apple that I swallowed
gave it an impetus that started it from its position;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
but it was not for some time, that to me appeared
hours, that the fish was disposed of. And even then
it left its traces; and if it would be any satisfaction
to the fish to know that ample vengeance was taken
for its death, it must have been thoroughly gratified.</p>

<p>There are few fish more favoured in point of decoration
than the stickleback; although the decoration,
like that of soldiers, is only given to the gentlemen,
and of them only to the victors in fight.</p>

<p>They are most irritable and pugnacious creatures,
that is, in the early spring months, when the great
business of the nursery is in progress. And the word
nursery is used advisedly; for the stickleback does
not leave her eggs to the mercy of the waters, but
establishes a domicile, over which her husband keeps
guard.</p>

<p>The vigilance of this little sentry is wonderful;
and I have often seen fierce fights taking place. Not
a fish passes within a certain distance of the forbidden
spot, but out darts the stickleback like an arrow,
all his spines at their full stretch, and his body
glowing with green and scarlet. So furious is the
fish at this time that I have sometimes amused
myself by making him fight a walking-stick.</p>

<p>If the stick were placed in the water at the distance
of a yard or so, no notice was taken. But as the
stick was drawn through the water, the watchful
sentinel issued from his place of concealment, and
when the intruding stick came within the charmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
circle, the stickleback shot at it with such violence
that he quite jarred the stick.</p>

<p>His nose must have suffered terribly. If the stick
were moved, another attack would take place, and
this would be continued as long as I liked.</p>

<p>Sometimes a rival male comes by, with all <em>his</em>
swords drawn ready for battle, and his colours of red
and green flying. Then there is a fight that would
require the pen of Homer to describe. These
valiant warriors dart at each other; they bite, they
manœuvre, they strike with their spines, and sometimes
a well-aimed cut will rip up the body of the
adversary, and send him to the bottom, dead.</p>

<p>When one of the combatants prefers ignominious
flight to a glorious death, he is pursued by the victor
with relentless fury, and may think himself fortunate
if he escapes.</p>

<p>Then comes a curious result. The conqueror
assumes brighter colours and a more insolent demeanour;
his green is tinged with gold, his scarlet
is of a triple dye, and he charges more furiously than
ever at intruders, or those whom he is pleased to
consider as such. But the vanquished warrior is
disgraced; he retires humbly to some obscure retreat;
he loses his red, and green, and gold uniform, and
becomes a plain civilian in drab.</p>

<p>Sometimes I have brought on a battle royal between
the guardians of several palaces, by dropping in
the midst of them a temptation which they could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
resist. This was generally a fine fat grub taken
from a caddis case. The caddis is large and white,
and so can be seen to a considerable distance.</p>

<p>As this sank in the water, there would be a general
rush at it, and the ensuing contention was amusing
in the extreme. First, one would catch it in his
mouth and shoot off; half-a-dozen others would
unite in chase, overtake the too fortunate one, seize
the grub from all sides, and tug desperately, their
tails flying, their fins at work, and the whole mass
revolving like a wheel, the centre of which was the
caddis worm.</p>

<p>It would be swallowed almost immediately, but
the mouth of the stickleback is much too small to
admit an entire caddis, and the skin of the grub is
too tough to be easily pierced or torn. Half-an-hour
often elapses before the great question is settled, and
the caddis eaten.</p>

<p>The rapidity of the evolutions and the fierceness
of the struggle must be seen to be appreciated&mdash;and
it is a spectacle easily to be witnessed; wherever
there are sticklebacks, caddis worms are nearly certainly
found, and it only needs to extract one of
these from its case and deposit it judiciously in the
water.</p>

<p>The stickleback is a hardy little fish, and can
easily be kept in the aquarium, if plenty of room be
given to it. It has even been trained to live in seawater,
by adding bay-salt to the water in which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
dwelt; so that the plan of pickling salmon alive, by
a judicious admixture of vinegar and allspice with
the water, has something to which to appeal as collateral
evidence.</p>

<p>The other representative of the fishes is a very
curious one, and can be easily observed. It is called
the “Lampern,” and is shown in the accompanying
figure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus22.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE LAMPERN.</p>
</div>

<p>In some parts of England the lampern goes by the
name of “Seven-eyes,” in allusion to the row of
eye-like holes that may be seen extending along the
side of the throat. These apertures are the openings
by which the water passes from the gills.</p>

<p>The chief external peculiarity in this creature is
the mouth, which, instead of being formed with jaws
like those of other fishes, resembles none of them,
not even those of the eel, which it most resembles
externally. Indeed, on looking at the mouth of a
lampern, one is forcibly reminded of the leech, for it
is possessed of no jaws, and adheres firmly to the
skin by exhaustion of the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Very delicate food are these lamperns, quite as
good as the lampreys themselves, whose excellence
is reported to have cost England one of her kings;
yet I never knew but one person who would eat
them, and very few who would even touch them,
they also being called poisonous.</p>

<p>In Germany they know better, and not only eat
the lamperns themselves, but, packing them up in
company with vinegar, bay leaves, and spices, export
them as an article of sale.</p>

<p>The solitary sensible individual of whom I have
made mention was truly a wise man. He used to
offer the young urchins of the neighbourhood a reward
for bringing lamperns, at the rate of a halfpenny
per wisketful.</p>

<p>A wisket, I may observe, is a kind of shallow basket,
made of very broad strips of willow; and a wisket filled
with lamperns would be a tolerable load for a boy.</p>

<p>So, for the sum of one halfpenny, that philosopher
was furnished with provisions for a day or more.</p>

<p>Really, the prejudice against the lampern is most
singular. Even near London, when lamperns lived
in vast numbers in the Thames, they were only used
as bait, being sold for that purpose to the Dutch
fishermen. In one season, four hundred thousand
of these creatures have been sold merely for bait for
cod-fish and turbot.</p>

<p>The scientific name for the lampreys is “<em>Petromyzon</em>,”
a word signifying “stone-sucker”. The name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
is rightly applied; for when the lampern wishes to
remain still in one place, it applies its mouth to a
stone, sticks tightly to it by suction, and there remains
firmly at anchor, and defying the power of
the stream. In favourable spots, thousands of these
fish may be seen together, quite blackening the
bottom of the stream with their numbers. They
seem specially to affect shallow mountain streams;
and, in spite of the rapid current, wriggle their
devious way up the stream with great rapidity.
When they are not quite pleased with the spot on
which they settle down for the time, they scoop it
out to their minds in a very short time. This task
is accomplished by means of the sucker-like mouth.
If a stone is placed in a position that incommodes
them, they affix their mouths to it, and drag it away
down the stream. In this way they will remove
stones which are apparently beyond the power of so
small a creature. By perseverance they thus scoop
out small hollows, about eighteen inches long and a
foot wide, in which they lie in groups so thick that I
have more than once mistaken them for dark logs
lying in the stream, and was only undeceived by the
waving of the multitudinous tails. Year after year
the lamperns followed the same course, and chose
the same positions, so that we could at any time tell
where these creatures would be found by the thousand,
where they would be found singly, and where
none would be seen at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The general thickness of this creature is that of a
large pencil, but it varies according to the individual.
The length is from one foot to fifteen inches or so.</p>

<p>There is a much smaller species of lampern called
the Pride, Sand-pride, or Mud Lamprey, which is
not more than half the length of the lampern, and
only about the thickness of an ordinary quill. This
creature has not the power of affixing itself like
the lampern, on account of the construction of its
mouth.</p>

<p>Having now taken a hasty glance at the vertebrated
animals, we pass to those who have no bones
at all, and whose skeleton, so to speak, is carried
outside. Our representation of aquatic crustacea,
as such creatures are called, will be the Cray-fish
and the Water-Shrimp.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus23.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE CRAY-FISH.</p>
</div>

<p>Every one knows the Cray-fish, because it is so
like a lobster, turning red when boiled in the same
way. This red colour is brought out by heat even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
applied by placing the shell before a fire, and spirits
of wine has the same effect. The last fact I learned
from experience, and was very sorry that it <em>was</em> a
fact, for the red shell quite spoiled the appearance
of a dissected cray-fish that was wanted to look nice
in a museum.</p>

<p>Being very delicate food, and, in my opinion, much
better than the native lobster, they are much sought
after at the proper season, and are sold generally at
the rate of half-a-crown for one hundred and twenty.</p>

<p>There are many modes of catching them, which
may be practised indifferently. There are the
“wheels,” for example, being wicker baskets made
on the wire mouse-trap principle, which the cray-fish
enters and cannot get out again. Also, there is
a mode of fishing for them with circular nets baited
with a piece of meat. A number of these nets are
laid at intervals along the river bank, and after a
while are suddenly pulled out of the water, bringing
with them the cray-fish that were devouring the
meat.</p>

<p>But the most interesting and exciting mode of
cray-fish catching is by getting into the water, and
pulling them out of their holes.</p>

<p>Cray-fish take to themselves certain nooks and
crannies, formed by the roots of willows or other
trees that grow on the bank; and they not unfrequently
take possession of holes which have been
scooped by the water-rat. The hand is thrust into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
every crevice that can be detected, and if there is a
cray-fish, its presence is made known by the sharp
thorny points of the head,&mdash;for the cray-fish always
lies in the hole with its head towards the entrance.</p>

<p>The business is, then, to draw the creature out of
its stronghold without being bitten&mdash;a matter of no
small difficulty. If the hole is small, and the cray-fish
large, I always used to draw it forward by the
antennæ or horns, and then seize it across the back,
so that its claws were useless.</p>

<p>The power of the claws is extraordinary, considering
the size of the creature that bears them. They
will often pinch so hard as to bring blood; and when
they have once secured a firm hold, they do not
easily become loosened. Still, the risk of a bite
constitutes one of the chief charms of the chase.</p>

<p>The legitimate mode of disposing of the cray-fish,
when taken, is to put them into the hat, and the hat
on the head; but they stick their claws into the
head so continually, and pull the hair so hard, that
only people of tough skin can endure them.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when the bed of the river is stony, the
cray-fish live among and under the stones, and then
they are difficult of capture; for with one flap of
their tail they can shoot through the water to a great
distance, and quite out of reach.</p>

<p>It is not unfrequent to find a cray-fish with one
large claw and the other very small. The same circumstance
may be noted in lobsters. The reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of this peculiarity is, that the claw has been injured,
generally in single combat; for the cray-fish are
terrible fighters, and the mutilated limb has been
cast off. Most wonderfully is this managed.</p>

<p>The blood-vessels of the crustaceans are necessarily
so formed, that if wounded, they cannot easily heal;
and if there were no provision against accidents, the
creature might soon bleed to death.</p>

<p>But when a limb, say one of the claws, is wounded
the limb is thrown off&mdash;not at the injured spot, but
at the joint immediately above. The space exposed
at the joints is very small in comparison with that
of an entire claw; and as the amputation takes place
at a spot where there is a soft membrane, it speedily
closes. In process of time, a new limb begins to
sprout, and takes the place of the member that had
been thrown off.</p>

<p>The eyes of the cray-fish are set on footstalks, so
as to be turned in any direction, and they can also
be partially drawn back, if threatened by danger. If
the eye is examined through a magnifying glass of
tolerable power, it will be seen that it is not a single
eye, but a compound organ, containing a great
number of separate eyes, arranged in a wonderful
order. As, however, a description of an insect’s eye
will be given at a succeeding page, we at present
pass over this organ.</p>

<p>At the proper season of the year, the female cray-fish
may be seen laden with a large mass of eggs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
which she carries about with her, and by the movement
of the false legs that are arranged in double
rows on the under surface of the tail, keeps them
supplied with fresh streams of water. In process of
time, the eggs are hatched; but very few, in comparison,
reach maturity. Even the mother herself is
apt to eat her own young, when they have set themselves
free from her control. I have known this to
take place when we were trying to breed cray-fish in
a tank. Only one attained to any size, and even
that was not so large as a house-fly when we took it
from the water.</p>

<p>The fresh-water Shrimp may generally be found in
plenty in any running stream. Its appearance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
habits very much resemble the Sandhopper, a little
creature that every one must have seen who has
walked on a sandy sea-shore. Like the cray-fish,
this little creature carries its eggs about until they
are hatched. It is a carnivorous animal, and is one
of the numerous scavengers of the water, without
whose help every stream would soon become putrid
and loathsome.</p>

<p class="caption">WOODLOUSE, ARMADILLO, AND PILL MILLEPEDE.</p>
</div>

<p>Certain species of crustacea inhabit the land; two
of which are well known under the titles of Woodlouse
and Armadillo. They belong to the class of
crustaceans called “<em>Isopod</em>,” or equal-footed, because
the legs are all of the same nature; whereas, in the
other crustacean, some legs are used for walking, and
others are turned into claws, &amp;c. The woodlouse is
to be found in myriads under the scaly bark of trees,
under stones, and, in fact, in almost every crevice.
It feeds mostly on decayed vegetable matters, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
also eats animal substances, and vegetables that are
not decayed. Some gardeners hold the woodlouse
in great horror, and say that nothing is so hard or so
bitter that a woodlouse will not eat it. If the bark
is removed from an ancient willow tree, any number
of these creatures may be discovered, in every stage of
existence, scuttling about in great fear at the unwelcome
light, and sticking close to the wood in
hopes that they may not be seen. Dried coats of the
woodlouse may be also seen, empty and bleached to
an ivory whiteness. They are night-feeders; and,
although they can run fast enough if disturbed,
walk very deliberately when only employed in
feeding.</p>

<p>The Armadillo-woodlouse is very curious, and
easily recognised from its habit of rolling itself into a
round ball when alarmed, just like the quadruped
armadillo. Its habits are much the same as those
of the common woodlouse. Formerly the armadillo
was used in medicine, being swallowed as a pill in
its rolled-up state. I have seen a drawer half full
of these creatures, all dry and rolled up, ready to be
swallowed.</p>

<p>On the preceding cut are two armadillo-like
animals, much resembling each other, but belonging
to different orders. Fig. <i>a</i> is the Woodlouse; <i>b</i>, the
Pill Millepede, walking; <i>c</i>, the same rolled up; <i>d</i> is
the true Armadillo, walking; and <i>e</i>, the same creature
rolled up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the minute crustaceans, the common
Cyclops, is shown on <a href="#plateJ">plate J</a>, fig. 14. Its length is
about the fourteenth of an inch; and though it is so
small, the female Cyclops may easily be detected in
the water by the curious egg-sacs.</p>

</div>

<p>As, in common with many other animals, mankind
are furnished with legs, and the power to move them,
it is universally acknowledged that those limbs ought
to be put to their proper use. But while men agree
respecting the importance of the members alluded to,
they differ greatly in the mode of employing them.</p>

<p>To the tailor, for example, legs are chiefly valuable
as cushions, whereon to lay his cloth. For the
jockey, the same members form a bifurcated or
pronged apparatus, by the help of which he sticks
on a horse. The legs of the acrobat are mostly employed
to show the extent of ill-treatment to which
the hip-joint can be subjected without suffering permanent
dislocation. The dancer values his leg solely
on account of the “light fantastic toe” which it
carries at its extremity. The turner sees that two
legs are absolutely necessary to mankind&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to stand upon, and the other to make a wheel run
round. The surgeon views legs&mdash;on other people&mdash;as
objects affording facilities for amputation. The
boxer professionally regards his legs as “pins,” upon
which the striking apparatus is kept off the ground.
The soldier’s opinion of his legs is modified according
to the temperament of the individual, and the position
of the enemy. Some people employ their legs in
continually mounting the same stairs, and never
getting any higher; while others use those limbs in
continually pacing the same path and never going
any farther.</p>

<p>And of all these modes of employing the legs, the
last, which is called “taking a walk,” is the dreariest
and least excusable.</p>

<p>For, in the preceding cases, the owners of the legs
gain their living, or at all events their life, by such
employment of those members; and in the case of
the interminable stairs, the individual is not acting
by his own free will. But it does seem wonderful
that a being possessed of intellectual powers should
fancy himself to be the possessor of a right leg and
a left one, merely that the right should mechanically
pass the left so many thousand times daily and in its
turn be passed by the left; while the sentient being
above was occupied in exactly the same manner as
if both legs were at rest, snugly tucked under a table.</p>

<p>Sad to relate, such is the general method of taking
recreation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>A man who has been over-tasking his brain all the
early part of the day, rises corporeally from his work
at a certain time, places his hat above his brain,
buttons his coat underneath it, and sallies forth to
take a walk.</p>

<p>Whatever subject he may be working upon he
takes with him, and on that subject he concentrates
his attention. Supposing him to be a mathematician,
and that the prevalent idea in his mind is to prove
that △ A B C = (∠ D E F + ∠ G H I). He takes
one final look at his Euclid while drawing on his
gloves, and sets off with A B C before his eyes.</p>

<p>As he walks along, he sees nothing but A B C,
hears nothing but D E F, feels nothing but G H I,
and thinks of nothing but the connection of all
three.</p>

<p>An hour has passed away and he re-enters his
room without any very definite recollection of the
manner in which he got there. He has mechanically
paced to a certain point, mechanically stopped and
turned round, mechanically retraced his steps, and
mechanically come back again.</p>

<p>He has not the least recollection of anything that
happened during his walk; he don’t know whether
the sky was blue or cloudy, whether there was any
wind, nor would he venture to say decidedly whether
it was night or day. He <em>does</em> recollect seeing a tree
on a hill and a spire in a valley, because, together
with himself, they formed an angle that illustrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the proportions of the triangle A B C; but whether
the tree had leaves or not he could not tell. But he
is happy in the consciousness of having performed
his duty;&mdash;he has taken a walk, he has been for a
“constitutional”.</p>

<p>O deluded and misguided individual! The walking
powers are meant to carry yourself&mdash;not only
your corporeal body&mdash;into other scenes, to give a
fresh current to your thoughts, and to give your brain
an airing as well as your nose. The mind requires
variety in its food, as does the body; and to obtain that
change of nutriment is the proper object of taking a
walk.</p>

<p>That a rational being can condemn himself to walk
three miles along a turnpike road, and three miles
back again, at one uniform pace, his eyes directed
straight ahead, and his thoughts at home with his
books, seems incredible to ordinary personages.</p>

<p>Yet, such British fakirs may be seen daily in all
weathers, on the roads leading from university towns,
going at the rate of four miles per hour, their hats
tilted towards the back of their heads, their bodies
inclining forward at an angle of eighty degrees, their
lips muttering polysyllabic language, and their eyes
as beaming as those of a boiled cod-fish.</p>

<p>Now the real use of taking a walk is to get away
from one’s self, and to change the current of the
thoughts for a while, by changing the locality of the
individual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>In order so to do, he should cast his senses abroad
instead of concentrating them all within himself;
and from sky, air, water, and earth draw a new succession
of images wherewith to relieve the monotony
within. There are various modes of attaining this
object; and each man will follow that mode which
most accords with his own character.</p>

<p>For example, if he is an astronomer, he will look
to the heavenly bodies; if a geologist, his eyes will
be directed to the earth; if a botanist, his mind
seeks employment among the vegetable productions;
if a meteorologist, the wind’s temperature and atmospheric
phenomena will claim his attention; if an
entomologist, he will find recreation in watching the
phases of insect life, and so on.</p>

<p>It is evident enough that to treat of all these subjects
would render necessary a volume that numbered
its pages by thousands, and its volumes by at least
tens; and therefore, in a work of this nature, it
must be sufficient to lay particular stress on one
portion, to treat slightly of others, and to leave
many entirely untouched. And that portion on
which I shall lay the chief stress is that which is
brought more constantly before the eye and ear than
any other, namely, the entomological department.</p>

<p>As, when approaching cities, the “busy hum of
men” is the first indication that meets the ear, so
in the country the busy hum of insects is, next to
the song of the birds, the sound that gives strongest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
evidence of a life untrammelled by the artificial rules
of society.</p>

<p>Not only do insects make their presence known to
the ear, but they also address themselves to the eye.
Their forms may be seen flitting through the air,
running upon the ground, or making their abode on
the various examples of vegetable life. Comparatively
small as insects are, they are of vast importance
collectively; and there is hardly a leaf of a
tree, a blade of grass, or a square inch of ground,
where we may not trace the work of some insect.
Nearly all strange and curious objects that are
noticed by observant eyes in the woods or fields are
caused by the action of insects, and are often the
insects themselves, in one or other of the phases of
their varied life. Certain examples of insect life,
and its effects, will now be given. No particular
order will be observed, no long scientific terms will
be used, and every creature that is mentioned will
be so common that it may be found almost in every
field.</p>

<p>The first creature that we will notice is that caterpillar
which is so abundantly found at several seasons
of the spring and summer, and, from the long hairy
skin in which it is enveloped, goes by the popular
name of the “Woolly Bear!” A figure of this
creature may be seen in <a href="#plateB">plate B</a>, fig. 5 <i>a</i>. This
creature is the larva of the common Tiger-moth,
which is represented on the same plate, fig. 5.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be necessary to pause here a little, before
proceeding to the description and histories of the
various insects, because in the course of description
certain terms must be used, which must be explained
in order to make the description intelligible.</p>

<p>In the first place, let it be laid down as a definite
rule, that</p>

<p class="center">INSECTS NEVER GROW.</p>

<p>Many people fancy that a little fly is only little
because it is young, and that it will grow up in process
of time to be as big as a blue-bottle. Now this
idea is entirely wrong; for when an insect has once
attained to its winged state, it grows no more. All
the growing, and most part of the eating, is done in
its previous states of life; and, indeed, there are
many insects, such as the silkworm-moth, which do
not eat at all from the time that they assume the
chrysalis state to the time when they die.</p>

<p>It is a universal rule in nature, that nothing comes
to its perfection at once, but has to pass through a
series of changes, which if carefully examined can
mostly be reduced to three in number. Sometimes
these changes glide imperceptibly into each other,
but mostly each stage of progress is marked clearly
and distinctly. Such is the case with the insect of
which we are now considering; and when we have
examined the development of the Tiger-moth through
its phases of existence, we have the key to the remainder
of the insects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>After an insect has left the egg, and entered upon
the world as an individual being, it has to pass
through three stages, which are called larva, pupa,
and imago.</p>

<p>The word “larva,” in Latin, signifies “a mask,”
and this word is used because the insect is at that
time “masked,” so to speak, under a covering quite
different from that which it will finally assume. In
the present instance, the Tiger-moth is so effectually
masked under the Woolly Bear, that no one who was
ignorant of the fact would imagine two creatures so
dissimilar to have any connection with each other.</p>

<p>Throughout this work the word “larva” will be
always understood to signify the first of the three
states of insect life, whether it be a “caterpillar,” a
“grub,” or a “worm”.</p>

<p>In its next stage the insect becomes a “pupa,”
which word means a “mummy,” or a body wrapped
in swaddling clothes. This name is employed because
in very many insects the pupa is quite still, is
shut up without the power of escape, and looks altogether
much like a mummy, wrapped round in folds
of cloth. In the moths and butterflies the insect in
this stage is called a “chrysalis,” or “aurelia,” both
words having the same import, the first Greek and the
other Latin, both derived from a word meaning “gold”.
Several butterflies&mdash;that of the common cabbage
butterfly, for example&mdash;take a beautiful golden tinge
on their pupal garments, and from these individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
instances the golden title has been universally bestowed.</p>

<p>The last, and perfected state, is called the “imago,”
or image, because now each individual is an image
and representative of the entire species.</p>

<p>The Woolly Bear, then, is the larva of the Tiger-moth;
and if any inquiring reader would like to keep
the creature, and watch it through its stages, he will
find it an interesting occupation. There is less
difficulty than with most insects, for the creature is
very hardy, and the plant on which it mostly feeds
is exceedingly common.</p>

<p>Generally, the Woolly Bear is found feeding on
the common blind nettle, but it may often be
detected at some distance from its food, getting over
the ground at a great rate, and reminding the spectator
of the porcupine. In this case it is usually
seeking for a retired spot, whither it resorts for the
purpose of passing the helpless period of pupa-hood.</p>

<p>If it is captured on such an occasion, there will be
little trouble in feeding, as it will generally refuse
food altogether, and, betaking itself to a quiet corner,
prepare for its next stage of existence.</p>

<p>If taken at an earlier period of its life, it feeds
greedily on the nettle above-mentioned, and the
amount of nutriment which one caterpillar will consume
is perfectly astounding. I once had nearly
four hundred of them all alive at the same time, and
they used to be furnished with nettles by the armful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Of course so large a number is not necessary for
ordinary purposes; but this regiment was required
for the purpose of watching the development and
anatomy of the creature through its entire life.</p>

<p>As the skins of caterpillars are not capable of
growth, and the creature itself grows with singular
rapidity, it is evident that the skins themselves must
be changed, as is the case with many other animals
of a higher class, such as the snakes, newts, &amp;c.</p>

<p>For this purpose the skin of the caterpillar splits
along the back of the neck, and by degrees the creature
emerges, soft, moist, and helpless. A very short
time suffices for the hardening of the new envelope;
and as the caterpillar has been obliged to fast for
a day or two, previously to changing the skin, it sets
to work to make up for lost time, and does make up
effectually.</p>

<p>In the case of the Woolly Bear, and several others,
the cast skin retains nearly the same shape and
appearance as when it formed the living envelope of
the caterpillar; and, consequently, if any number of
these insects are kept, the interior of their habitation
soon becomes peopled with these imitation caterpillars.
Each individual changes its skin some ten
or eleven times, each time leaving behind it a model
of its former self, so that caterpillars seem to multiply
almost miraculously.</p>

<p>Although even the exterior appearance of an insect
is very wonderful, yet its interior anatomy is, if possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
even more wonderful, and, if possible, should
be examined. The mode of doing so is simple and
easy. If the Woolly Bear, for example, is to be dissected,
the easiest mode of doing so is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Get a shallow vessel, glass if possible, about an
inch or so in depth; load a flat piece of cork with
lead, put it at the bottom of the vessel, and fill it
nearly to the top with water. Now take the caterpillar,
which may be killed by a momentary immersion
in boiling water, or by being placed in spirits of
wine, and with a few minikin pins fasten it on its
back on the cork. The pins of course must only just
run through the skin, and two will be sufficient at
first, one at each end.</p>

<p>Now take a pair of fine scissors, and carefully slit
up the skin the entire length of the creature, draw
the skin aside right and left, and pin it down to the
cork.</p>

<p>The creature will now exhibit portions of organs of
different shapes and characters, the remainder being
concealed under the mass of fat that is collected in
the interior. This fat must be carefully removed in
order to show the vital organs; and this object is
best attained by using a fine needle stuck into a
handle. I generally use a common crochet-needle
handle, so that needles of various sizes can be used
at pleasure.</p>

<p>Now will appear a number of organs closely packed
together, and mostly stretching along the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
length of the creature. In order to assist the inquirer,
I here present a plan or chart of the interior
of the caterpillar when thus opened. It must be understood
that the drawing is not meant to represent
the particular anatomy of any one species, but to
give a general view, by means of which the anatomical
details of any caterpillar may be recognised.
And in order to give greater distinctness,
only one of each organ
is seen, though with the exception
of the intestinal canal, there is a
double set of each organ, one on
each side.</p>

<p>Running in a straight line from
head to tail is seen the digestive
apparatus, consisting of throat,
stomach, and intestines, with their
modifications; and this apparatus
is marked <span class="smcapuc">A A</span> in the cut.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus27.jpg" width="200" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">INTERIOR OF CATERPILLAR.</p>
</div>

<p>On the surface of the digestive
apparatus, and straight along its
centre, lies the nervous system,
represented by tiny white threads
dotted at regular distances by
rather larger spots of the same
substance. If the nerve is examined closely, it
will be seen to be composed of <em>two</em> very slender
threads, lying closely against each other, but easily
separable: in which state they are shown. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
little knobs are called “ganglia,” each forming a
nervous centre, from which smaller nerves radiate to
the different portions of the body.</p>

<p>As for brains, the caterpillar dispenses with them
almost entirely; and instead of wearing one large
brain in the head, is furnished with a row of lesser
brains, or ganglia, extending through its whole
length. This is the reason why caterpillars are so
tenacious of life. If a man loses his head, he dies
immediately; but an insect is not nearly so fastidious,
and continues to live for a long time without any
head at all. Indeed, there are some insects, which,
if beheaded, die, not so much on account of the head,
but of the stomach: for, having then no mouth, they
cannot eat, and so die of hunger. And some insects
there are which positively live longer if decapitated
than if left in possession of their head.</p>

<p>On the right hand may be seen a curiously twisted
organ, marked <span class="smcapuc">C</span>, swelling to a considerable size in
the middle, and diminishing to a mere thread at each
end. This is one of the vessels that contain the silk,
or rather the substance which becomes silk when it
is spun.</p>

<p>If this organ be cut open in the middle, it will
be seen filled with a gummy substance of curious
texture, partly brittle and partly tough. From this
substance silk is spun, by passing up the tube,
through the thread-like portion, and so at last
into a tiny tube, called the spinneret, which opens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
from the mouth, and wherefrom it issues in a fine
thread.</p>

<p>There are two of these silk-making organs, and
both unite in the spinneret. Consequently, if silk
is examined in the microscope, the double thread
can clearly be made out, both threads adhering to
each other, but still distinguishable. If the threads
lie parallel to each other, the silk is good; if not so,
it is of an inferior quality, and liable to snap.</p>

<p>Most caterpillars possess this silk-factory, but
some have it much more largely developed than
others&mdash;the silk-worm, for instance. It is of considerable
size in the larva which we are examining,
because the Woolly Bear has to spin for itself a
silken hammock in which to swing while it is in the
sleep of its pupal state. Just before it begins to spin,
the organ is of very large size, and distended with
the liquid silk; but after the hammock is completed,
the organ diminishes to a mere thread, and is soon
altogether absorbed.</p>

<p>At the left hand of the drawing may be seen a
curious structure, marked <span class="smcapuc">B B</span>. This is the chief
portion of the respiratory system, and may be at
once recognised by the ringed structure of the tube.
Indeed it is quite analogous to that of the windpipe
in animals.</p>

<p>The mode in which insects breathe differs much
from that of the higher animals. In them the
breathing apparatus is gathered into one mass, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
lungs or gills, as the case may be; but with insects,
the respiratory system runs entirely over, round, and
through the body, even to the tips of the claws, and
the end of the feelers or antennæ.</p>

<p>Every internal organ is also surrounded and enveloped
by the breathing tubes; and this often to such
an extent, that the dissector is sadly perplexed how
to remove the tracheal tubes, as they are called,
without injuring the organs to which they so tightly
cling. Sometimes they are so strongly bound together,
that they may be removed like a net, but
mostly each must be taken away separately. The
mode in which these tracheal tubes supply the digestive
apparatus may be seen at <i>b b</i>; and as there is a
double set of them, it may be seen how closely they
envelop the organ to which they direct their course.</p>

<p>The ringed structure runs throughout the entire
course of the air tubes, and is caused by a thread
running spirally between the two membranes of
which the tube is composed. The object of this
curious thread is to keep the tube always distended,
and ready for the passage of air. Otherwise, whenever
the insect bends its flexible body, it would cut
off the supply of air in every tube which partook of
the flexure of the body.</p>

<p>The structure is precisely similar to that of a spiral
wire bell-spring; and so strong is the thread, that
I have succeeded in unwinding nearly two inches
of it from the trachea of a humble bee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The air obtains entrance into these tubes, not
through the mouth or nostrils, but through a set of
oval apertures arranged along the sides of the insect,
which apertures are called “spiracles”; and two of
them are indicated at <i>b* b*</i>.</p>

<p>In order to prevent dust, water, or anything but
air, from entering, the spiracles are defended by an
elaborate <i lang="fr">chevaux de frise</i> of hair, or rather quill, so
disposed as to keep out every particle that could injure.
So powerful are these defences, that, even
under the air-pump, I was unable to force a single
particle of mercury through them, though a stick will
be entirely permeated by the metal, so that if cut it
starts from every pore. I kept the creature in a vacuum
for three days, then plunged it under mercury,
and let in the air. Even then no effect was produced,
except that the whole of the stomach and
intestinal canal were charged with mercury.</p>

<p>But, though the spiracles are such excellent defences
against obnoxious substances, they are not
capable of throwing off any substance that may
choke them. Consequently, nothing is easier than
to kill an insect humanely, if one only knows how;
and few things more difficult, if one does not know.</p>

<p>For example, if ladies catch a wasp they proceed
to immolate it by snipping it in two with their scissors;
a dreadfully cruel process, for the poor creature
has still some four or five brains left intact, and lives
for many hours. But if a feather is dipped in oil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and swept across the body of the creature, it collapses,
turns on its back, and dies straightway.
For the oil has stopped up the spiracles, and so the
supply of air is cut off from every portion of the
body at once. The same rule holds good with all
insects.</p>

<p>There is yet one more organ to which I must
draw attention, and that is the curious bag-shaped
object marked <span class="smcapuc">E</span>.</p>

<p>Just as the silk is contained in the vessel <span class="smcapuc">C</span>, so the
saliva is contained in <span class="smcapuc">E</span>, and is developed according
to the character and habits of the insect. Some insects
require a large supply of that liquid, which is
used for various purposes, and others require comparatively
little. The caterpillar in which these
receptacles may be found best developed is the larva
of the Goat-moth, which may be easily found within
the substance of decaying trees. Of the Goat-moth
we may speak in a future page.</p>

<p>If the reader will again refer to the engraving on
<a href="#Page_100">p. 100</a>, he will see that between the tracheal tube
and the digestive apparatus is a curiously waved
line, forming two loops in its upper portion, and
running into a confused entanglement below. This
entanglement, however, is only apparent, for in
nature there is no entangling; all is perfect in order.</p>

<p>This wavy line represents one of the numerous
thread-like vessels that surround this portion of the
digestive apparatus, and are called the biliary vessels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
being, in fact, the insect’s liver. There is a large
mass of these biliary vessels, and they are found so
closely entwined among each other, and so encircled
with the air tubes, that to separate them is no
easy matter. Their microscopic structure is curious,
and will repay a careful examination.</p>

<p>In examining the creature for the first time, the
dissector will be tolerably sure to damage the organs
and unfit it for preservation, and therefore it is best
to take such a course for granted, and to make the
best of it.</p>

<p>Removing all these vital organs, he should then
examine the wonderful and most complicated muscular
structure, by which the caterpillar is enabled
to lengthen, shorten, twist, and bend its body in almost
any direction, and that with such power that
many caterpillars are enabled to stretch themselves
horizontally into the air, and there to keep themselves
motionless for hours together.</p>

<p>Few people have any idea of the wonders that
they will find inside even so lowly a creature as a
caterpillar&mdash;wonders, too, that only increase in number
and beauty the more closely they are examined.
When the outer form has been carefully made out,
there yet remains the microscopical view, and after
that the chemical, in either of which lie hidden innumerable
treasures.</p>

<p>A very forcible and unsophisticated opinion was
once expressed to me, after I had dissected and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
explained the anatomy of a silk-worm to an elderly
friend. He remained silent for some time, and
then uttered disconnected exclamations of astonishment.</p>

<p>I asked him what had so much astonished him.</p>

<p>“Why,” said he, “it’s that caterpillar. It is a
new world to me. I always thought that caterpillars
were nothing but skin and squash.”</p>

<p>Having now seen something of the exterior and
interior of the caterpillar, we will watch it as it
prepares for its next state of existence.</p>

<p>Hitherto it has been tolerably active, and if
alarmed while feeding, it curls itself round like a
hedgehog and falls to the ground, hoping to lie
concealed among the foliage, and guarded from the
effects of the fall by its hairy armour, which stands
out on all sides, and secures it from harm. But a
time approaches wherein it will have no defence and
no means of escape, so it must find a means of lying
quiet and concealed. This object it achieves in the
following manner.</p>

<p>It leaves its food, and sets off on its travels to find
a retired spot where it may sling its hammock and
sleep in peace. Having found a convenient spot, it
sets busily to work, and in a very short time spins
for itself a kind of silken net, much like a sailor’s
hammock in shape, and used in the same manner.
It is not a very solid piece of work, for the creature
can be seen through the meshes; but it is more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
sufficiently strong to bear the weight of the inclosed
insect, and to guard it from small foes.</p>

<p>On <a href="#plateB">plate B</a>, and fig. 5 <i>b</i>, the silken hammock is
represented, the form of the pupa inside being visible.
It casts off its skin for the last time, and instead of
being a hirsute and active caterpillar, becomes a
smooth and quiescent chrysalis. In this state it
abides for a time that varies according to the time
of year and the degree of temperature, and at last
bursts its earthly holdings, coming to the light of
the sun a perfect insect.</p>

<p>When first the creature becomes a chrysalis, its
colour is white, and its surface is bathed in an oily
kind of liquid, which soon hardens in the air, and
darkens in the light.</p>

<p>On one occasion, I watched a Woolly Bear changing
its skin, and, seizing it immediately that the
task was accomplished, put it into spirits of wine,
intending to keep it for observation.</p>

<p>Next day, the spirit was found to have dissolved
away the oily coating, and all the limbs and wings
of the future moth were standing boldly out.</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter, I must just remark
that the absence of scientific terms throughout the
work will be intentional, from a wish to make the
subject intelligible, instead of imposing. It would
have been easy enough to speak of the Woolly Bear
as the larva of Arctia Caja; to describe it as a chilognathiform
larva, with a subcylindrical body, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
no thoracic shield: passing through an obtected
metamorphosis, and becoming a pomeridian lepidopterous
imago; and to have proceeded in the same
style throughout. But as nearly every one who has
taken a country walk has seen Woolly Bears, and
hardly any one knows what is meant by “chilognathiform,”
the subject is treated of for the benefit
of the many, even at the risk of incurring the contempt
of the few.</p>

</div>

<p>Just at the right hand of the Tiger-moth, on <a href="#plateB">plate
B</a>, may be seen a caterpillar of a very strange and
eccentric form, and marked by the number 4 <i>a</i>.
This is the larva or caterpillar of the Puss-moth, and
is no less beautiful in colouring than fantastic in
form. Its attitude, too, when it is at rest, is quite
as curious as its general appearance.</p>

<p>While eating, it sits on the leaves and twigs much
as any other caterpillar; but when it ceases to feed,
and reposes itself, it grasps the twig firmly with the
claspers with which the hinder portion of its body is
furnished, and raises the fore-part of its body half
upright. In this attitude it much resembles that of
the Egyptian Sphinx, and from this circumstance
the moth itself is called a Sphinx. An old gardener
was once quite put out of temper by seeing several
of these caterpillars for the first time, because they
had so consequential an air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The colouring of this creature varies according to
the time of year; but it may be easily recognised by
its form alone, which is very peculiar.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable points in the creature
is the forked apparatus at the end of the tail, and
which frightens people who do not know the habits
of the caterpillar. These forks are black externally,
and rather stiff, but are only sheaths for two curious
rose-coloured tentacles, which are usually kept hidden,
but which may be seen by touching the caterpillar
with the point of a needle. When the creature is
thus irritated, it will protrude these tentacles from
their sheath, and will then strike the part that had
been touched.</p>

<p>It is supposed that this apparatus is intended as a
kind of whip, wherewith to drive away the ichneumon
flies, and other parasites, that inflict such annoyance
on many caterpillars.</p>

<p>When this caterpillar proceeds to its pupal state,
it makes itself a wonderful fortress&mdash;not suspended
like that of the Tiger-moth, nor hidden in a dark
spot; but it boldly fixes its residence on the exterior
of the tree on which it feeds, trusting to its similitude
to the bark for concealment, and to the strength of
its habitation for safety, even if discovered.</p>

<p>It is furnished with a gummy substance, something
after the manner of the silk of the Tiger-moth;
but instead of spinning that substance into threads,
it uses it in the following manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Biting little chips of wood from the bark of the
tree, the caterpillar glues them together with this
natural cement; and so builds an arched house for
itself, much about the size and shape of half a walnut-shell.
So strongly compacted is this residence, that
rain and wind have no effect on it, and a penknife
does not find an easy entrance.</p>

<p>One or two of these caterpillars which I brought
home modified their dwellings in a curious manner.
One of them nibbled to pieces a portion of a cardboard
box, and so made a kind of papier-maché
house; while others, who were placed under a glass
tumbler, and upon a stone surface, simply made
their house of the hardened gum. In this state, it
appeared as if it had been made of thin horn, and
was so transparent that the chrysalis could be seen
through the walls.</p>

<p>The caterpillar is common enough, and may be
found on the willow or poplar. And a sharp eye will
soon learn to detect the winter house, which to an
unpractised eye looks as if it were merely a natural
excrescence on the bark.</p>

<p>If one of these habitations is found, the best
mode of removing it is to avoid touching the dwelling
itself, but to cut away the bark round it; and
then, by inserting the point of a stout knife, gently
raise up the house, together with the bark on which
it is placed. This is one of the modes by which an
entomologist may find employment even during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
winter months, and others will be mentioned in the
course of this work.</p>

<p>The moth itself may be seen figured on <a href="#plateB">plate B</a>,
fig. 4. It is called the Puss-moth, on account of the
soft furry down with which its body is covered, and
it is fancifully thought to resemble the fur of the
cat.</p>

<p>It is rather a difficult moth to preserve effectually,
as it is apt to become “greasy”&mdash;that is, to have its
whole beauty destroyed by an oiliness that exudes
from the body, and gradually creeps even over the
wings. The best preservative is to remove the
contents of the abdomen, and stuff it with cotton-wool
that has been scented with spirits of turpentine.
But even that plan is rather precarious, and
the delicate, downy plumage is apt to be sadly
damaged during the process of stuffing.</p>

<p>Still keeping to the same plate, and referring to
the right-hand corner at the top, a moth of strange
aspect will be seen; and immediately below it an
object that somewhat resembles the hammock of
the Tiger-moth, affixed in a perpendicular instead of
an horizontal direction. This moth is called the
Burnet-moth, and the hammock is the pupa case of
the same insect.</p>

<p>The colouring of this moth is very rich and beautiful.
The two upper wings are green, and of a tint
so deep that, like green velvet, they almost appear
to be black. On each of these wings are several red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
spots, varying in number according to the species;
some wearing six spots, and others only five. The
two under wings are of a carmine red, edged with a
border of black, in which is a tinge of steely blue.
The body is velvety black, with the same blue tint.</p>

<p>The moth is rather local; but when one is found
in a field, hundreds will certainly be near.</p>

<p>At the best of times it is not an active insect, and
on a cold or a dull day hundreds of them may be
seen clinging to the upright grass stems, from which
they can be removed at pleasure.</p>

<p>The caterpillar of this beautiful moth keeps close
to the ground, and feeds on grasses, the speedwell,
dandelion, and other plants. When it is about to
become a pupa, it ascends some slender upright
plant, generally a grass stem, and then spins for
itself the residence which is represented on the
plate.</p>

<p>In this state it may be gathered, and placed under
a glass shade; and in the summer months the
perfect insect will make its appearance. There are
some places which it specially favours, and where it
may be found in great profusion. At Hastings, for
example, the fields about the cliffs were so populated
by these moths, that hardly a grass stem was without
its Burnet-moth’s habitation.</p>

<p>Feeding on the same plant as the Tiger-moth
caterpillar, may often be found another caterpillar
of a very different aspect. It is very much larger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and instead of presenting an array of stiff bristles,
is covered with thick soft hair of a yellowish-brown
colour, diversified with stripes of a deep velvety
black, arranged so as to resemble the slashed vestments
that were so fashionable some centuries ago.</p>

<p>This caterpillar is the larva of the Oak Egger-moth,
and is not so remarkable as a caterpillar as
for the house which it builds for its pupal residence.</p>

<p>After changing its skin the requisite number of
times, the caterpillar ceases to feed, and, proceeding
to some convenient spot (generally a faded thorn-branch),
spins its temporary habitation. This cocoon,
as it is called, is about an inch in length; and into
that narrow space the creature contrives to push,
not only itself, but also its last and largest skin.</p>

<p>The substance of the cocoon is hard and rather
brittle when dry; and in texture somewhat resembles
thin brown cardboard. In its substance,
and on its surface, are woven many of the hairs with
which the caterpillar is furnished. If the cocoon is
carefully opened, the chrysalis will be found within,
its head towards the spot where the moth is to
emerge, and the cast caterpillar-skin crumpled down
by its tail.</p>

<p>In course of time, the chrysalis passes through its
development, and the egger-moth itself pushes its
way out of the cocoon, with wings and body wet and
wrinkled, but soon to assume their proper form and
strength. The cocoon is shown at <a href="#plateI">plate I</a>, fig. 5 <i>a</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes the cocoon remains unbroken beyond
the proper season; and if it is examined, one or two
little holes will generally be found in it. These are
signs that the egger has met with an untimely fate,
and that it has fallen a victim to those scourges of
the insect world, the ichneumon flies. Of these
creatures we shall speak in a future page, and therefore
omit to describe them here. The moth is shown
at fig. 5.</p>

<p>If the moth is intended to be killed, and then
placed in a cabinet, the use of sulphur must be
avoided. It kills the moth, certainly; but it kills
the colours also, and quite ruins its appearance.
Sulphur is always a dangerous instrument in insect-killing,
and should on no account be used. There
are many ways of destroying insects humanely, and
extinguishing their life as if by a lightning flash;
but these modes vary according to the size, sex, and
nature of the insect. Some of them I will here
mention.</p>

<p>If the insect is a beetle, it may be plunged into
boiling water, or into spirits of wine, in which a very
little corrosive sublimate has been dissolved. Both
modes will destroy the life rapidly, but the former is
the better of the two. When walking in the fields
or woods, a wide-mouthed, strong bottle, about half
full of spirits of wine, is a useful auxiliary, as all
kinds of beetles, and even flies and bees, can be put
into it; and if dried in a thorough draught, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
look as well as before. If this precaution be not
taken, all the insects that have long hair, as the
humble-bee and others, will lose their good looks,
and their hair will be matted together in unseemly
elf-locks.</p>

<p>Butterflies, and most of the Diptera, or two-winged
flies, can be instantaneously killed by a sharp pinch
on the under-surface of the thorax among the legs,
as the great mass of nerves is there collected. Many
people seem to fancy that the head is the vital part
in an insect; and having pinched or run a pin
through its head, they think that they have effectually
slain the creature, and marvel much to see it
lively some twenty-four hours afterwards.</p>

<p>Especially is this the case with the large-bodied
moths, whose vitality is quite astonishing. You may
even stamp upon them, and yet not crush the life
out of that frail casket. If you drive the life out of
one-half of the creature, it only seems to take refuge
in the other; and then retain a more powerful hold,
like a garrison driven into a small redoubt.</p>

<p>It is not at all uncommon to find one of these
moths dead and dry as to its wings and limbs, which
snap like withered sticks if touched, and yet with so
much life in it as to writhe its abdomen if irritated,
and to deposit its eggs just as if it were in full activity.</p>

<p>Indeed, so strong is this power that the creature
seems to be gifted with a double life, one for itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and the other for its progeny. The former is comparatively
weak, and but loosely clings to its home;
but the latter intrenches itself in every organ, penetrates
every fibre, and, until its great work is
completed, refuses to be expelled. So, unless the
entire mechanism of the insect be killed, the poor
creature may live for days in pain.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a mode of so doing; and this
is the way of doing it:&mdash;</p>

<p>Make a strong solution of oxalic acid, or get a little
bottle of prussic acid&mdash;it is the better of the two, if
you have discretion as beseems a naturalist. Also
make a bone or iron instrument, something like a pen,
but without a nib. Dip this instrument into the
poison as you would a pen, and then you have a
weapon as deadly as the cobra’s tooth, and infinitely
more rapid in its work. Now hold your moth delicately
as entomologists hold moths, near the root
of the wings. Keep the creature from fluttering;
plunge the instrument smartly into the thorax,
between the insertion of the first and second pair of
legs; withdraw it as smartly, and the effect will be
instantaneous. The moth will stretch out all its
legs to their full extent; there will be a slight quiver
of the extremities; they will be gently folded over
each other; and you lay your dead moth on the
table.</p>

<p>The reason of this rapid decease is of a twofold
nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first place, the chief nerve mass is cut
asunder, and even thus a large portion of the life is
destroyed. But the chief breathing tubes are also
severed, and a drop of poison deposited at their
severed portions. Consequently, at the next inspiration,
either the poison itself or its subtle atmosphere
rushes to every part, and to every joint of the insect,
thus carrying death through its whole substance.</p>

<p>The male insect is very different in appearance to
the female, and in general is hardly more than two-thirds
of her size. The colours, too, are very different;
for in the male insect the wings are partially
of a dark chestnut brown, with a light band running
round them, as may be seen in the engraving; while
in the female the wings are almost entirely of a
uniform yellowish brown.</p>

<p>The antennæ, too, of the male are deeply cleft,
like the teeth of a comb; while those of the female
are narrow, and comparatively slightly toothed.</p>

<p>As is the case with several other moths, the male
oak eggers are sad victims to the tender passion,
and fall in love not only at first sight, but long
before they see the object of their affection at all.</p>

<p>If a female egger is caught immediately after her
entrance into the regions of air, and placed in a
perforated box near an open window, her unseen
charms will be so powerfully felt by gentlemen of
her own race that they will flock to the casket that
contains their desired treasure, and fearlessly run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
about it, fluttering their wings, and striving to gain
admission. So entirely do they abandon themselves
to the captivity of love, that they do not fear the
risk of a bodily captivity, and will suffer themselves
to be taken by hand, without even an endeavour to
escape.</p>

<p>Carry the imprisoned moth into the fields, and
even there the eager suitors will arrive from all
quarters, and boldly alight on the box while in the
hand of the entomologist.</p>

<p>More wonderful must be the influence that can
emanate from so small a creature, and extend to so
great a distance&mdash;an influence which, although
entirely inappreciable by any human sense, exercises
so potent a sway on all sides, and to so great a
distance.</p>

<p>The conditions, too, of this mysterious influence
are singularly delicate; for after the moth has once
found her mate, she may be placed amid a crowd of
gentlemen, and not one will take the least notice of
her.</p>

<p>Like the young beauty of the ball-room, who
whilom attracted to herself crowds of beaux, that
fluttered around her, and contended with each other
for a look or a smile of their temporary divinity, but
who finds herself deserted by the fickle crowd when
her election is made; so our Lady Lasiocampa
Quercus, after setting all hearts ablaze for a time,
makes happy one favoured individual, is deserted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the many rejected, and left in quiet to the duties of
a wife and a mother.</p>

<p>Her married life is but short, for her husband
rarely survives his happiness more than a few hours,
and she, after making due preparation for the welfare
of her numerous family, whom she is never to
see, feels that she has fulfilled her destiny, and gives
up a life which has now no further object.</p>

<p>There is really something very human in the life
even of an insect. Many a life story have I watched
in the insect world, which, if transferred to the
human world, would be full of interest. There is
also one great advantage in the insect life, namely,
that as it only consists of a year or two, the events
of several successive generations come under the observation
of a single historian.</p>

<p>First, a number of tiny, purposeless beings come
into the world, spreading about much at random,
and seeming to have no other object except to eat.
It is but just to them to say that they don’t cry, and
are always contented with the food that is given
them.</p>

<p>They rapidly increase in size, pass through a regular
series of childish complaints, which we mass
together under this single term, “moulting,” but
which are probably to their senses as distinct as
measles, and chicken-pox, and hooping-cough.</p>

<p>They outgrow a great many suits of clothes in a
wonderfully short period; they retire for a time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
finish their education; and then come before the
world in all the glory of their new attire.</p>

<p>Up to this time they are nearly exactly alike in
habits and manners; but, when freed from the
trammels that held them, they diverge, each in his
appointed way, each exulting for a short space in the
buoyancy of youth, and fluttering indeterminately in
the new world, but soon settling down to the business
for which they were made.</p>

<p>So even in insects a human soul can find a companionship,
and a solitary man need never feel entirely
alone as long as he can watch the life of a humble
moth, and see in that despised creature some manifestations
of the same feelings which actuate himself.</p>

<p>And it even seems that, through this companionship,
the higher nature communicates itself in some
degree to the lower, as is shown by the many
instances of men who have tamed spiders and other
creatures quite as far removed from the human
nature. In such a case it seems very clear that either
the higher nature gives to the lower an intelligence
not its own, or that it develops powers which would
have lain dormant had they not been called forth by
the contact of a superior being.</p>

<p>This subject is a very wide one, and well worth
following up. But as it runs through the whole
creation, and this book is only to consist of a few
pages, it must suffice merely to put forth the idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>To pass to another insect.</p>

<p>On <a href="#plateE">plate E</a>, and fig. 1 and 1 <i>a</i>, may be seen an insect
which somewhat resembles the oak egger-moth,
and is often mistaken for it by inexperienced eyes.
This is the “Drinker” moth, remarkable for the
thick furry coat which it wears, as a caterpillar and
as a moth, and which it employs in the construction
of its cocoon. This moth is one of my particular
friends; and I have had hundreds of them from the
egg to their perfect state. I had quite a large
establishment for the education and development of
lepidoptera, and especially favoured the tiger-moth,
the oak egger, and the drinker.</p>

<p>The caterpillar of this moth is entirely covered
with dense hair, even down to the very feet; and by
means of this protection it is enabled to brave the
winter frost, needing not to pass the cold months in
a torpid state. It is a pretty caterpillar, and very
easily recognised by the figure. Its chief peculiarities
are the two tufts of hair that it bears at its opposite
extremities, and the double line of black spots along
its sides.</p>

<p>Generally, it feeds on various grasses, but it is not
dainty, as are many caterpillars; and I have always
found it to eat freely of the same food as the oak
egger larva. This caterpillar is seen at fig. 1 <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>When alarmed, it loosens its hold of the plant on
which it is feeding, rolls itself into a ring, and drops
to the ground, hoping to evade notice among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
foliage. This habit used to be rather perplexing to
me, not because the creature could escape by so well-known
a trick, but because it would not go into the
box prepared for its reception.</p>

<p>It is necessary to have a box of a peculiar form for
the collection of caterpillars. If the lid is raised
every time that a fresh capture is made, difficulties
increase in proportion to the number of caterpillars.
For, when some thirty larvæ are in the box, they all
begin to crawl out when the lid is opened; and
Hercules had hardly a more bewildering task among
the hydra’s heads than the entomologist among his
captives.</p>

<p>No sooner is the light admitted, than a dozen
heads are over the side; and as fast as one is replaced,
six or seven more make their appearance.
The only remedy is to sweep them all back with a
rapid movement of the hand, to shake them all to
the bottom, and then to replace the lid as fast as
possible. Even with all precaution, caterpillars are
crushed; and, besides, they are delicate in their
constitutions, and require gentle handling.</p>

<p>So the best plan is to have a tin box made with a
short tube, through which the caterpillars can be introduced,
and which can be stopped by a cork when
the creatures are fairly inside.</p>

<p>Now, although this is a capital contrivance for
caterpillars that hold themselves straight, it fails
entirely when they curl themselves into a ring and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
refuse to be straightened. It is as impossible to
straighten a rolled-up hedgehog as a caterpillar in a
similar attitude; and if force is used in either case,
the creature will be mortally injured. However,
gentle means succeed when violence fails, with
insects as with men. A Bheel robber will steal the
bedding from under a sleeping man without waking
him; and, by an analogous process, the refractory
caterpillar is lodged in his prison before he is
fairly awake to his condition.</p>

<p>The entomologist feels a justifiable pride in executing
similar achievements; for there is quite as
much force of intellect needed to outwit a caterpillar
as a quadruped.</p>

<p>When the drinker caterpillar passes into its
pupal state, it makes for itself a very curious cocoon,
not unlike a weaver’s shuttle in shape, being large in
the middle, and tapering to a point at each end.
The texture is soft and flexible, as if the cocoon
were made of very thin felt, and the
larval hairs are quite distinguishable
on its surface. The moth leaves the
cocoon about August. For the cocoon
see fig. 1 <i>c</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/illus28.jpg" width="100" height="150" alt="" />
<p class="caption">COCOON OF THE EMPEROR MOTH.</p>
</div>

<p>I found that few caterpillars are so
liable to the attack of ichneumon flies
as those of the drinker moth. A cocoon
now before me is pierced with
thirteen holes from which ichneumon flies have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
issued, having eaten up the caterpillar. The eggs
are shown in fig. 1 <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>If the reader will now refer to <a href="#plateC">plate C</a>, the central
figure will be found to represent a strikingly handsome
moth, called, from its gorgeous plumage, the
“Emperor Moth”.</p>

<p>Its body is covered with a thick downy raiment,
and the wings are clothed with plumage of a
peculiarly soft character, which is well represented
in the figure. The antennæ, too, are elaborately
feathered.</p>

<p>Although the beauty of this insect would entitle it
to notice in its perfect state, and the peculiar shape
of its larva&mdash;(see <a href="#plateC">plate C</a>, fig. 4 <i>a</i>)&mdash;would draw
attention, yet its chief title to admiration lies in the
cocoon which it constructs for its pupal existence.</p>

<p>Externally, there is nothing remarkable in the
cocoon; and, as may be seen in the same plate, fig.
4 <i>b</i>, it is a very ordinary, rough, flask-shaped piece
of workmanship. But if the outer covering be carefully
removed, or if the cocoon be divided lengthways,
a very wonderful structure is exhibited.</p>

<p>The inventor of lobster-pots is not known, and
history has failed to record the name of the man
who first made wire mouse-traps with conical entrances,
into which the mice can squeeze themselves,
but exit from which is impossible.</p>

<p>But, though the principle had not been applied to
lobsters or mice, it was in existence ages upon ages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
ago. Before human emperors had been invented,
and very probably long before mankind had been
placed on our earth, the caterpillar of the emperor
moth wove its wondrous cell, and thereby became a
silent teacher to the cunning race of mankind how
to make mouse-traps and lobster-pots.</p>

<p>For inside the rough outer case, which is composed
of silken threads, woven almost at random,
and very delicate, is a lesser case, corresponding in
shape with its covering, but made of stiff threads
laid nearly parallel to each other, their points converging
at the small end of the case. See the cut
on <a href="#Page_125">p. 125</a>.</p>

<p>It will now be seen that the moth when it leaves
its chrysalid case can easily walk out of the cocoon,
but that no other creature could enter. So within
its trapped case the chrysalis lies secure, until time
and warmth bring it to its perfection. It breaks
from its pupal shell, walks forward, the threads
separate to permit its egress, and then converge
again so closely that to all appearance the cocoon is
precisely the same as when the moth was within.</p>

<p>Now, any observant member of the human race,
who had been meditating upon traps, and happened
in a contemplative mood to open one of these cocoons,
would feel a new light break in upon him,
and, Archimedes-like, he would exclaim “Eureka,”
or its equivalent, “I have found my trap!” Reverse
the process, make the converging threads to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
lead into instead of out of the trap, and the thing
is done. “I will make it of wire, put it on my
shelf, and I catch mice and rats. I will make it of
osier, sink it to the bottom of the sea, and I catch
lobsters and crabs. I will lay it in a rapid, and I
catch roach and dace; I will place it under the river
banks, and then I have cray-fish.”</p>

<p>So might he soliloquise on the future achievements
of his newly-discovered principle. But unless
he had the prophetic afflatus strong within him,
never would he imagine that in future times his
discovery would catch a monarch and an Elector to
boot.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the insects mentioned in the
preceding chapter are mostly remarkable for the
cocoons which they construct, and that the peculiarities
of the larva and the perfect insect are but
casually mentioned. Those, however, which will be
noticed in this chapter are chosen because there is
“something rare and strange” in the habits and
manners of the creatures themselves.</p>

<p>As it will be more convenient to keep to the same
plate as much as possible, we still refer to <a href="#plateG">plate G</a>.
On casting the eye over the objects there depicted,
the strangest and most fantastic shape is evidently
that creature which is marked 5 <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>The aspect of the creature is almost appalling,
and it seems to glare at us with two malignant eyes,
threatening the poisoned blow which the horrid tail
seems well able to deliver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet this is as harmless a creature as lives, and it
can injure nothing except the leaves of the plant on
which it feeds. The eye-like spots are not eyes at
all, but simply markings on the surface of the skin,
and the formidable horn at the tail cannot scratch
the most delicate skin.</p>

<p>The creature is in fact simply the caterpillar of a
very beautiful moth, represented in fig. 5, and called
the Elephant Hawk-moth&mdash;elephant, on account of
its long proboscis, and hawk on account of its sharp
hawk-like wings and flight. The caterpillar may be
found in many places, and especially on the banks of
streams, feeding on various plants, such as the willow-herbs.</p>

<p>Another kind of hawk-moth is much more common
than the elephant, and is represented on <a href="#plateA">plate A</a>;
the moth itself at fig. 5, and its caterpillar at fig. 5 <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>This is called the Privet Hawk-moth, because the
caterpillar feeds on the leaves of that shrub. The
colours of both moth and caterpillar are very beautiful,
and not unlike in character.</p>

<p>The bright leafy green tint of the caterpillar, and
the seven rose-coloured stripes on each side, make it
a very conspicuous insect, and raise wishes that tints
so beautiful could be preserved. But as yet it cannot
be done, for even in the most successful specimens
the colours fade sadly in a day or two, and after a
while there is a determination towards a blackish
brown tint that cannot be checked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Any one, however, who wishes to try the experiment
may easily do so, for there are few privet
hedges without their inhabitants, who may keep out
of sight, but can be brought tumbling to the ground
by some sharp taps administered to the stems of the
bushes.</p>

<p>In the winter the chrysalis may be obtained by
digging under privet bushes. There the caterpillar
resorts, and works a kind of cell in the ground for its
reception. It is better not to choose a frosty day for
the disinterment, or the sudden cold may kill the insect,
and the seeker’s labour be lost.</p>

<p>Should it be desirable to capture the larva and to
keep it alive the object can be easily attained; for
the creature is hardy enough, and privet bushes grow
everywhere. In default of privet leaves, it will eat
those of the syringa and the ash. When it reaches
its full growth, it should be provided with a vessel
containing earth some inches in depth. Into this
earth it will burrow, and remain there until the moth
issues forth.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to keep the earth rather
moist, as otherwise the chrysalis skin becomes so
hard that the moth cannot break out of its prison,
and perishes miserably.</p>

<p>On the same plate, fig. 4, may be seen a moth of a
curious shape, very feathery about the thorax, the
head being all but concealed by the dense down, and
as difficult to find as the head of a Skye-terrier, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
not its position marked by the antennæ. This is
the Buff-tip Moth, so called on account of the upper
wing-tips being marked with buff-coloured scales.</p>

<p>The caterpillar, which is represented immediately
above, and marked 4 <i>a</i>, is a very singular creature,
its habits being indicated by the marks on its skin.
As soon as the young caterpillars are hatched, they
arrange themselves in regular order, much after the
fashion of the dark stripes, and so march over leaf
and branch, devastating their course with the same
ease and regularity as an invading army in an
enemy’s land.</p>

<p>When they increase to a tolerably large size, they
disband their forces, and each individual proceeds on
its own course of destruction. Were it not for the
colours which they assume, these creatures would do
great damage; but the ground being yellow and the
stripes black, the caterpillars are so conspicuous that
sharp-sighted birds soon find them out, and having
discovered a colony, hold revelry thereon, and exterminate
the band.</p>

<p>Comparatively few escape their foes and attain
maturity. When they have reached their full age,
they let themselves drop from the branches, and
when they come to soft ground, bury themselves
therein to await their last change. Individuals may
often be seen crossing gravel paths, which they are
unable to penetrate, and getting over the ground
with such speed and in so evident a hurry that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
seem to be aware that birds are on the watch and
ichneumons awaiting their opportunity.</p>

<p>There is a very pretty moth covered with a downy
white plumage even to the very toes, and carrying
at the extremity of its tail a tuft of golden silky hair.
From this coloured tuft, the creature bears the name
of Gold-tailed Moth. It may often be found sticking
tightly to the bark of tree stems, its glossy white
wings folded roof-like over its back, and the golden
tuft just showing itself from the white wings.</p>

<p>This golden tuft is only found fully developed in
the female moth, and comes into use when she deposits
her eggs. The moth is shown on <a href="#plateE">plate E</a>, fig.
4.</p>

<p>As the eggs are laid in the summer time, they
need no guard from cold; but they do require to be
sheltered from too high a degree of temperature,
and for this purpose the silken tuft is used.</p>

<p>At the very end of the tail the moth carries a pair
of pincers, which she can twist about in all directions;
and this tool is used for the proper settlement
of the eggs. The moth, after fixing on a proper
spot, pinches off a tiny tuft of down, spreads it
smoothly, lays an egg upon it, covers it over, and
finally combs the hair so as to lie evenly. And when
she has laid the full complement, she gives the whole
mass some finishing touches, like a mother tucking-in
her little baby in the bed-clothes, and smoothing
them neatly over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The egg masses are common enough, and are
readily discovered by means of their bright yellow
covering.</p>

<p>The caterpillar of this moth is a very brilliant
scarlet and black creature, commonly known by the
name of the “palmer-worm,” and to be found
plentifully of all sizes.</p>

<p>People possessed of delicate skins must beware of
touching the palmer-worm, or they may suffer for
their temerity. I was a victim to the creature for
some time before I discovered the reason of my
sufferings. And the case was as follows.</p>

<p>Being much struck with the vivid colours of the
caterpillar, I was anxious to preserve some specimens,
if possible, in a manner that would retain the
scarlet and black tints. One mode that seemed
feasible was to make a very small snuff-box, as
ladies call a rectangular rent, in the creature’s skin,
to remove the entire vital organs, to fill the space
with dry sand, and then, when the skin was quite
dry, to pour out all the sand, leaving the empty
skin.</p>

<p>After treating six or seven caterpillars in this
fashion, I perceived a violent irritation about my
face, lips, and eyes, which only became worse when
rubbed. In an hour or so my face was swollen into
a very horrid and withal a very absurd mass of
hard knobs, as if a number of young kidney potatoes
had been inserted under the skin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, I was invisible for some days, and after
returning to my work, was attacked in precisely the
same manner again. This second mischance set me
thinking; and on consultation with the medical
department, the fault was attributed to the hot sand
which I had been using.</p>

<p>So, when I went again to the work, I discarded
sand, and stuffed the caterpillars with cotton wool
cut very short, like chopped straw. My horror may
be conjectured, but not imagined, when I found, for
the third time, that my face was beginning to assume
its tubercular aspect.</p>

<p>Then I did what I ought to have done before,
went to my entomological books, and found that
various caterpillars possessed this “urticating” property,
as they learnedly called it, or as I should say,
that they stung worse than nettles. Since that
time, I have never touched a palmer-worm with my
fingers.</p>

<p>It was perhaps a proper punishment for neglecting
the knowledge that others had recorded. But I
always had rather an aversion to book entomology,
and used to work out an insect as far as possible,
and <em>then</em> see what books said about it. Certainly,
although not a very rapid mode of work, yet it was
a very sure one, and fixed the knowledge in the
mind.</p>

<p>On the same plate, fig. 4 <i>a</i>, is shown the caterpillar
of this moth, a creature conspicuous from the tufts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
beautifully-coloured hair which are set on its body
like camel-hair brushes.</p>

<p>The caterpillar spins for itself a silken nest wherein
to pass its pupa state, and in general there is
nothing remarkable about the nest. But I have
one in my collection of insect habitations that is
very curious.</p>

<p>I had caught, killed, and pinned out a large
dragon-fly, and placed it in a cardboard box for a
time. Some days afterwards, a palmer-worm had
been captured, and was imprisoned in the same box.
I was not aware that such a circumstance had
happened, and so did not open the box for a week
or two, when I expected to find the dragon-fly quite
dry and ready for the cabinet.</p>

<p>When, however, the box was opened, a curious
state of matters was disclosed. The caterpillar had
not only spun its cocoon, but had shredded up the
dragon-fly’s wings, and woven them into the substance
of its cell. The glittering particles of the
wing have a curious effect as they sparkle among the
silver fibres.</p>

<p>On <a href="#plateD">plate D</a>, fig. 3 <i>a</i>, is represented a creature
whose sole claim to admiration is its domestic
virtue, for elegance or beauty it has none. It
hardly seems possible, but it is the fact, that this
clumsy creature is the female Vapourer Moth, the
male being represented immediately below fig. 3.</p>

<p>Why the two sexes should be so entirely different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
in aspect, it is not easy to understand. The female
has only the smallest imaginable apologies for wings,
and during her whole lifetime never leaves her
home, seeming to despise earth as she cannot
attain air.</p>

<p>This moth is not obliged to form laboriously a
warm habitation for her eggs, for she places them
in a silken web which she occupied in her pupal
state, and from which she never travels.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, her eggs are not placed within
the hollow of the cocoon as might be supposed, but
are scattered irregularly and apparently at random
over its surface. Even there, though, they are
warm enough, for the cocoon itself is generally
placed in a sheltered spot, so that the eggs are
guarded from the undue influence of the elements,
and at the same time protected from too rapid
changes of temperature.</p>

<p>In the hot summer months, the leaves of trees are
crowded with insects of various kinds, which fly out
in alarm when the branches are sharply struck.
Oak trees are especially insect-haunted, and mostly
by one species of moth, a figure which is given on
<a href="#plateB">plate B</a>, fig. 1.</p>

<p>This little moth is a pretty object to the eyes, but
a terrible destructive creature when in its caterpillar
state, compensating for its diminutive size by its
collective numbers. The caterpillar is one of those
called “Leaf-Rollers,” because they roll up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
leaves on which they feed, and take up their habitation
within.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of leaf-rollers, each employing
a different mode of rolling the leaf, but in all
cases the leaf is held in position by the silken
threads spun by the caterpillar.</p>

<p>Some use three or four leaves to make one habitation,
by binding them together by their edges.
Some take a single leaf, and, fastening silken cords
to its edges, gradually contract them, until the edges
are brought together and there held. Some, not so
ambitious in their tastes, content themselves with a
portion of a leaf, snipping out the parts that they
require and rolling it round.</p>

<p>The insect before us, however, requires an entire
leaf for its habitation, and there lies in tolerable
security from enemies. There are plenty of birds
about the trees, and they know well enough that
within the circled leaves little caterpillars reside.
But they do not find that they can always make a
meal on the caterpillars, and for the following
reason.</p>

<p>The curled leaf is like a tube open on both ends,
the caterpillar lying snugly in the interior. So,
when the bird puts its beak into one end of the tube,
the caterpillar tumbles out at the other, and lets
itself drop to the distance of some feet, supporting
itself by a silken thread that it spins.</p>

<p>The bird finds that its prey has escaped, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
having sufficient inductive reason to trace the silken
thread and so find the caterpillar, goes off to try its
fortune elsewhere. The danger being over, the
caterpillar ascends its silken ladder, and quietly
regains possession of its home.</p>

<p>Myriads of these rolled leaves may be found on
the oak trees, and the caterpillars may be driven out
in numbers by a sharp jar given to a branch. It is
quite amusing to see the simultaneous descent of
some hundred caterpillars, each swaying in the
breeze at the end of the line, and occasionally dropping
another foot or so, as if dissatisfied with its
position.</p>

<p>Each caterpillar consumes about three or four
leaves in the whole of its existence, and literally eats
itself out of house and home. But when it has eaten
one house, it only has to walk a few steps to find the
materials of another, and in a very short time it is
newly lodged and boarded.</p>

<p>The perfect insect is called the “Green Oak Moth”.
The colour of its two upper wings is a bright apple
green; and as the creature generally sits with its
wings closed over its back, it harmonises so perfectly
with the green oak leaves, that even an accustomed
eye fails to perceive it. So numerous are these little
moths, that their progeny would shortly devastate a
forest, were they not subject to the attacks of another
insect. This insect is a little fly of a shape something
resembling that of a large gnat; and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
has, as far as I know, no English name. Its scientific
title is Empis. There are several species of
this useful fly, one attaining some size; but the one
that claims our notice just at present is the little
empis, scientifically Empis Tessellata.</p>

<p>I well remember how much I was struck with the
discovery that the empis preyed on the little oak
moths, and the manner in which they did so.</p>

<p>One summer’s day, I was entomologising in a
wood, when a curious kind of insect caught my
attention. I could make nothing of it, for it was
partly green, like a butterfly or moth, and partly
glittering like a fly, and had passed out of reach
before it could be approached. On walking to the
spot whence it had come, I found many of the same
creatures flying about, and apparently enjoying
themselves very much.</p>

<p>A sweep of the net captured four or five; and then
was disclosed the secret. The compound creature
was, in fact, a living empis, clasping in its arms the
body of an oak moth which it had killed, and into
whose body its long beak was driven. I might have
caught hundreds if it had been desirable. The grasp
of the fly was wonderful, and if the creature had
been magnified to the human size, it would have
afforded the very type of a remorseless, deadly, unyielding
gripe. Never did miser tighter grasp a
golden coin, than the empis fastens its hold on its
green prey. Never did usurer suck his client more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
thoroughly than the empis drains the life juices from
the victim moth.</p>

<p>He is a terrible fellow, this empis, quiet and insignificant
in aspect, with a sober brown coat, slim
and genteel legs, and just a modest little tuft on the
top of his head. But, woe is me for the gay and
very green insect that flies within reach of this
estimable individual.</p>

<p>The great hornet that comes rushing by is not
half so dangerous, for all his sharp teeth and his
terrible sting. The stag-beetle may frighten our
green young friend out of his senses by his truculent
aspect and gigantic stature. But better a thousand
stag-beetles than one little empis. For when once
the slim and genteel legs have come on the track of
the little moth, it is all over with him. Claw after
claw is hooked on him, gradually and surely the
clasp tightens, and when once he is hopelessly
captured, out comes a horrid long bill, and drains
him dry. Poor green little moth!</p>

<p>Still continuing our research among the oak
leaves, we shall find many of them marked in a very
peculiar manner. A white wavy line meanders
about the leaf like the course of a river, and, even as
the river, increases in width as it proceeds on its
course. This effect is produced by the caterpillar of
one of the leaf-mining insects, tiny creatures, which
live between the layers of the leaf, and eat their way
about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course, the larger the creature becomes, the
more food it eats, the more space it occupies, and the
wider is its road; so that, although at its commencement
the path is no wider than a needle-scratch, it
becomes nearly the fifth of an inch wide at its termination.
It is easy to trace the insect, and to find
it at the widest extremity of its path, either as caterpillar
or chrysalis. Often, though, the creature has
escaped, and the empty case is the only relic of its
being.</p>

<p>There are many insects which are leaf-miners in
their larval state. Very many of them belong to the
minutest known examples of the moth tribes, the
very humming bird of the moths, and, like the humming
birds, resplendent in colours beyond description.
These Micro-Lepidoptera, as they are called, are so
numerous, that the study of them and their habits
has become quite a distinct branch of insect lore.</p>

<p>Some, again, are the larvæ of certain flies, while
others are the larvæ of small beetles. Their tastes,
too, are very comprehensive, for there are few indigenous
plants whose leaves show no sign of the
miner’s track, and even in the leaves of many imported
plants the meandering path may be seen.</p>

<p>There are some plants, such as the eglantine, the
dewberry, and others, that are especially the haunts
of these insects, and on whose branches nearly every
other leaf is marked with the winding path. I have
now before me a little branch containing seven leaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and six of them have been tunnelled, while one leaf
has been occupied by two insects, each keeping to his
own side.</p>

<p>The course which these creatures pursue is very
curious. Sometimes, as in the figure on <a href="#plateA">plate A</a>, fig.
1, the caterpillar makes a decided and bold track,
keeping mostly to the central portion of the leaf.</p>

<p>Sometimes it makes a confused tortuous jumble of
paths, so that it is not easy to discover any definite
course.</p>

<p>Sometimes it prefers the edges of the leaves, and
skirts them with strange exactness, adapting its
course to every notch, and following the outline as if
it were tracing a plan.</p>

<p>This propensity seems to exhibit itself most
strongly in the deeply cut leaves. And the shape or
direction of the path seems to be as property belonging
to this species of the insect which makes it; for
there may be tracks of totally distinct forms, and yet
the insects producing them are found to belong to
the same species.</p>

<p>If the twigs of an ordinary thorn bush be examined
during the winter months, many of them will be seen
surrounded with curious little objects, called “fairy
bracelets” by the vulgar, and by the learned “ova of
Clisiocampa Neustria”. These are the eggs of the
Lackey Moth, and are fastened round the twigs by
the mother insect, a brown-coloured moth, that may
be found in any number at the right time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>It is wonderful how the shape of the egg is adapted
to the peculiar form into which they have to be
moulded, and how perfectly they all fit together.
Each egg is much wider at the top than at the
bottom; and this increase of width is so accurately
proportioned, that when the eggs are fitted together
round a branch, the circle described by their upper
surfaces corresponds precisely with that of the
branch.</p>

<p>These eggs are left exposed to every change of the
elements, and are frequently actually enveloped in a
coat of ice when a frost suddenly succeeds a thaw.
But they are guarded from actual contact with ice
and snow by a coating of varnish which is laid over
them, and which performs the double office of acting
as a waterproof garment and of gluing the eggs
firmly together. So tightly do they adhere to each
other, that if the twig be cut off close to the bracelet
the little egg circlet can be slipped off entire.</p>

<p>The accompanying cut is a good representation of a
very singular creature called the “Lappet Moth”.
As may be seen by the engraving, when it is settled
quietly upon a leaf with folded wings, it bears a closer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
resemblance to a bundle of withered leaves than to
any living creature. In this strange form lies its
chief safety, for there are few eyes sufficiently sharp
to detect an insect while hiding its character under
so strange a mask.</p>

<p>There are several other examples of this curious
resemblance between the animal and vegetable kingdoms,
one or two of which will be mentioned in succeeding
pages.</p>

<p>The name of “Lappet Moth” is hardly applicable,
as it ought rather to be called the moth of the lappet
caterpillar. This title is given to the creature
because it is furnished with a series of fleshy protuberances
along the sides, to which objects the
name of lappets has been fancifully given.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed to be a rare moth; but I
have not found much difficulty in procuring specimens
either in the larval state or as moths. Both
moth and caterpillar are of a large size, the caterpillar
being about the length and thickness of a
man’s finger. Its colour is a tolerably dark grey, but
subject to some variation in tint. There is no difficulty
in ascertaining this species of the creature, as
it is clearly distinguished from caterpillars of a
similar shape or line by two blue marks on the back
of its neck, as if a fine brush filled with blue paint
had been twice drawn smartly across it. The curious
“lappets” too are so conspicuous that they alone
would be sufficient for identification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the examples of animal life simulating vegetation
now comes before us in the person of the
Brimstone Moth, or rather its caterpillar.</p>

<p>This is a very common insect, and may be recognised
at once by its portrait on <a href="#plateC">plate C</a>, fig. 3.</p>

<p>The caterpillar is represented immediately above,
fig. 3 <i>a</i>. This is one of the caterpillars called
“Loopers,” on account of their peculiar mode of
walking.</p>

<p>They have no legs on the middle portion of their
bodies, but only the usual six little legs at the three
rings nearest the head, and a few false legs by the
tail; so when they want to walk, they attain their
object by holding fast with their false or pro-legs as
they are called, and stretching themselves forward to
their fullest extent. The real legs then take their
hold, and the pro-legs are drawn up to them, thus
making the creature put up its back like an angry
cat.</p>

<p>The grasp of the pro-legs is wonderfully powerful,
and in them lies the chief peculiarity of the creature.
The surface of the body is of a brownish tint, just
resembling that of the little twigs on which it sits;
there are rings and lines on its surface that simulate
the cracks and irregularities of the bark, and in one
or two places it is furnished with sham thorns.</p>

<p>Trusting in its mask, the caterpillar grasps the
twig firmly, stretches out its body to its full length,
and so remains, rigid and immovable as the twigs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
themselves. People have been known to frighten
themselves very much by taking hold of a caterpillar,
thinking it to be a dead branch.</p>

<p>The only precaution taken by the creature is to
have a thread ready spun from its mouth to the
branch, so that if it should be discovered, it might
drop down suddenly, and when the danger was
over, climb up its rope and regain its home.</p>

<p>The commonest of the loopers is the well-known
caterpillar of the Currant or Magpie Moth, <a href="#plateE">plate E</a>,
fig. 3. This creature is remarkable from the circumstance
that its colours are of the same character
throughout its entire existence; the caterpillar, chrysalis,
and perfect moth showing a similar rich colour
and variety of tint, as seen on figs. 3 <i>a</i> and 3 <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that almost every stratagem of
animals is used by man; whether intuitively, or
whether on account of taking a hint, I cannot say.</p>

<p>For example, Parkyns, the Abyssinian traveller,
tells an amusing tale of a party of Barea robbers,
who when pursued got up a <i lang="fr">tableau vivant</i> at a
moment’s notice. One man personated a charred
tree-stump, and the others converted themselves
into blackened logs and stones lying about its base.</p>

<p>It seemed so impossible for human beings to
remain so still, that a rifle-ball was sent towards the
stump, and caused it to take to its heels, followed by
the logs and stones.</p>

<p>I have heard of a similar stratagem that was put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in force by a robber who was interrupted on his way
into the tent by the appearance of its inmate, an
officer. He was so completely deceived, that he
actually hung his helmet on one of the branches,
which branch was in fact the robber’s leg. The
joke was almost too good, but the stump stood fast,
until the officer leaned his back against it. Officer
and stump came to the ground together, and the
stump escaped, carrying off the helmet as a trophy.
I think that he deserved it.</p>

<p>I conclude this chapter with a short notice of five
beautiful and curious little moths.</p>

<p>The first of these, the “Currant Clear-wing,” is
frequently mistaken for a gnat or a fly, and it is
sometimes a difficult task to persuade those who are
unaccustomed to insects that it can be a moth. As
a general rule, the wings of moths are covered with
feathers, and many are even as downy in their texture
as the plumage of the owl. But there is a
family of moth, called the clear-wings, whose wings
are as transparent as those of bees or flies. Some of
these are as large as hornets, and resemble these
insects closely in general aspect.</p>

<p>Some fourteen or fifteen species of these curious
creatures are found in England; and each of them
bears so close a likeness to some other insect, that it
is named accordingly. For example, the species
which we are now examining is called the “gnat-like
Egeria,” another is the “bee-like,” another the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
“hornet-like,” another the “ant-like,” and so on.
<a href="#plateA">Plate A</a>, fig. 3.</p>

<p>The currant clear-wing may be found on the
leaves of currant bushes, where it loves to rest.
In 1856 I took a great number of them in one small
garden, often finding two or more specimens on one
currant bush.</p>

<p>Next come two beautiful examples of the Plume
Moth, the White Plume and the Twenty Plume.</p>

<p>The first of these insects is very common on hedges
or the skirts of copses, and comes out just about dusk,
when it may be easily captured, its white wings making
it very conspicuous. See <a href="#plateH">Plate H</a>, fig. 9.</p>

<p>The chief distinguishing point in the plume moth
is that the wings are deeply cut from the point almost
to the very base, and thus more resemble the wings
of birds than those of insects.</p>

<p>In the white plume there are five of these rays or
plumes, three belonging to the upper pair of wings
and two to the lower.</p>

<p>From the peculiarly long and delicate down with
which the body and wings are covered, it is no easy
matter to secure the moth without damaging its
aspect. The scissors-net is, perhaps, the best that
can be used for their capture; for, as they always sit
on leaves and grass with their wings extended, they
are inclosed at once in a proper position, and cannot
struggle. A sharp pinch in the thorax from the
forceps, which a collector ought always to have with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
him, kills the creature instantly; for it holds life on
very slender tenure. The slender entomological pin
can then be passed through the thorax, while the net
is still closed, and thus the head of the pin can be
drawn through the meshes of the net when it is
opened.</p>

<p>In this way the moth may be preserved without
the least injury to its appearance, or without ruffling
the vanes of one of its beautiful plumes.</p>

<p>Of all the plume moths this is the largest, as a fine
specimen will sometimes measure more than an inch
across the wings. There is a brown species, nearly
as large, and quite as common; but which is often
overlooked on account of its sober colouring; and
as often mistaken for a common “daddy-long-legs,”
to which fly it bears a close resemblance.</p>

<p>The Twenty-plume Moth (<a href="#plateC">plate C</a>, fig. 9) is hardly
named as it deserves; for as the wings on each side
are divided into twelve plumes, it ought to be named
the twenty-four plume. A better title is that of the
“Many-plume Moth”.</p>

<p>It is very much smaller than either of the preceding
“plumes”; and its radiating feathers are so
small and so numerous, that at a hasty glance it
scarcely seems to present any remarkable structure.
It must be examined with the aid of a magnifying
glass before its real beauty can be distinguished.</p>

<p>The moth is common enough, and may be easily
caught, as it has a strange liking for civilised society,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and constantly enters houses. As insects generally
do, it flies to the window, and scuds unceasingly up
and down the panes of glass, just as if it wished to
make itself as conspicuous as possible.</p>

<p>The last of our moths is the beautiful Long-horn,
for a figure of which see <a href="#plateH">plate H</a>, fig. 4. Another
Long-horn Moth, the Green Adela, is shown on
<a href="#plateC">plate C</a>, fig. 10. It is nearly as common as the last-mentioned
insect.</p>

<p>It is a horrid name, for its agricultural associations
are so potent, that the idea conveyed to the
mind by the term “Long-horn” is that of a huge
bovine quadruped, with sleek solid sides telling of
oil-cake, with horns that are long enough to spike
four men at once, two on each horn, and with a
ponderous tread that rivals that of the hippopotamus.</p>

<p>Whereas, our little moth is the epitome of every
fragile, fairy-like beauty, and seems fitter for fairy
tale, “once upon a time,” than for this nineteenth
century. Its “horns,” as the antennæ are called,
are wondrously long and slender. I have just taken
measurement of one of these moths, and find that
the body and head together are barely a quarter of
an inch in length, while the antennæ are an inch
and a quarter long. It is hardly possible to conceive
any living structure more delicately slender than
their antennæ. The moth delights in sunny glades,
as so sunny a creature ought to do; it sits on a leaf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
basking in the glaring sunbeams, while its antennæ,
waving about in graceful curves, are only to be traced
by the light that sparkles along them. They are as
slender as the gossamer threads floating in the air,
and like them only seen as lines of light. They are
too delicate even for Mab’s chariot traces. The
grey-coated gnat might use one of them as his whip:
but it would only be for show, as beseemeth the
whip of a stage-coach; for it could not hurt the
tiniest atomy ever harnessed.</p>

<p>And yet the little Adela, for such is her scientific
title, flies undauntedly among the trees, threading
her way with perfect ease through the thickest foliage,
her wondrous antennæ escaping all injury, and
gleaming now and then as a stray sunbeam touches
them.</p>

<p>There is nothing very striking in the Adela’s external
appearance; she is just a pretty, unobtrusive,
bronze-coloured little thing, from whom many an
eye would turn with indifference, if not with contempt.
Truly, in vain are there pearls, while the
swinish nature prefers dry husks.</p>

<p>Place this quiet, bronze-coloured little creature
under a microscope, and Cinderella herself never exhibited
such a transformation. The mind of man
has never conceived a robe so gorgeous as that which
enwraps a small brown moth. Refulgent golden
feathers cover its body and wings, sparkling gemlike
points scatter light in all directions, while on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the edges of each feather rainbow tints dance and
quiver. It seems as if the creature wore two robes&mdash;a
loose golden-feather vesture above, and the rainbow
itself beneath. Each fibre of the fringe that
edges the wings is a prism, and even the slender
antennæ are covered with golden feathers. Words
cannot describe the wondrous beauty of this creature.</p>

<p>Methinks a view of these earthly creatures can the
better enable one to appreciate the ineffable glories
of the heavenly beings. Even the earth-insect is
beautiful beyond the power of words to describe&mdash;how
much more so the heavenly angel!</p>

<p>When the study of entomology first rose to the
dignity of a science, it was found necessary that each
insect should be distinguished by a definite title.
Formerly, it was necessary to describe the insect
when speaking of it; and in consequence both
cabinets and memories were overloaded with words.</p>

<p>For example, the Meadow-brown Butterfly was
named “Papilio media alis superioribus superne
media parte rufis”. In English: “The middle-sized
butterfly, the centre of whose upper wings are reddish
on the upper surface”. Cromwell’s Puritan
soldier might have taken a lesson in nomenclature
from an entomologist cabinet; and it is not easy to
say which would occupy the greater time in reading,
the list of butterflies or the regimental roll-call.
These difficulties being patent, the nomenclators
leaped at once, as is the habit of human nature, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the opposite extreme; and so, instead of making an
insect name an elaborate description of its appearance,
gave it a title which did not describe it at all,
and would have been just as applicable to any other
insect. Old Homer’s pages afforded a valuable
treasury of names; and accordingly, Greek and
Trojan may reasonably be astonished to find their
names again revived on earth.</p>

<p>Even our British butterflies have appropriated
Homeric titles. For example, the two first on the
list are named Machaon and Podalirius, known to
students of Homer as the two medical officers that
accompanied the Greek army.</p>

<p>Numerous, however, as are the Homeric heroes
and heroines, the insects far outnumbered them.
So, after exhausting Homer, the dramatists were
called into requisition, and plundered of their
“personæ”. Fiction failing, history, or that which
is dignified by the name of history, was next sought;
and kings, queens, generals, and statesmen lent
their names to swell the insect catalogue.</p>

<p>The Latin authors now are required to make up
the deficiency, Terence being especially useful. We
have in our English list Davus, Pamphilus, and
Chrysis, all out of one play, the “Andria”.</p>

<p>At last, when Greek and Latin, prose and verse,
history and mythology, had been quite exhausted,
some enterprising and imaginative men boldly invented
new names for new insects. The import of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the name was of no consequence to them, and any
harmonious combination of syllables was all that
they required. Many a valuable hour have they
wasted, or rather caused others to waste, in seeking
through lexicons and dictionaries for the purpose
of discovering the derivation of those unmeaning
and underived names.</p>

<p>At last men of science began to see that the name
ought to be descriptive of the creature, or its habits,
and yet as short as possible; and when this idea was
matured, true nomenclature began. In the reformed
system, insects are gathered together in societies,
through which some general characteristic runs, and
each individual bears the name of its genus, as the
society is called; and also a second name that distinguishes
its species.</p>

<p>The first butterfly which will be mentioned in
these pages is seen figured on <a href="#plateD">plate D</a>, fig. 4; and
very appropriately bears the name of Atalanta. Those
skilled in mythology, or Mangnall’s skimmings thereof,
will remember that Atalanta was a young lady, so
swift of foot that she could run over the sea without
splashing her ankles, or on the corn-fields without
bending an ear of corn under her weight. The flight
of this butterfly is so easy and graceful, that poetical
entomologists invested it with the name of the swift-footed
Atalanta.</p>

<p>Also it is called the Scarlet-Admiral, in which two
names is to be seen the confusion respecting sexes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
which is found in nautical matters generally. Perhaps
the discrepancy might have been avoided by
calling the butterfly Cleopatra, that lady being her
own admiral.</p>

<p>Few insects are so conspicuous, or have so magnificent
an effect on the wing, as the Atalanta; its
velvety-black wings, with their scarlet bands, white
spots, and azure edges, presenting a bold contrast of
colour that is seldom seen, and in its way cannot be
surpassed. It is certainly a grand insect; and it
seems to be quite aware of its own beauty as it
comes sailing through the sunny glades, gracefully
inclining from side to side, as if to show its colours
to the best advantage. Perhaps its best aspect is
when it sits upon a teazle-head, quietly fanning its
wings in the sun; for the quiet purple and brown
tints of the teazle set off the magnificent pure colours
of the insect.</p>

<p>These brilliant colours are only found on the
upper surface of the wings, the under surface being
covered with elaborate tracery of blacks, browns,
ambers, sober blues, and dusky reds, so that when
the wings are closed over the creature’s back, it is
hardly to be distinguished from a dried leaf, unless
examined closely.</p>

<p>This distinction of tint often proves to be the insect’s
best refuge; for, if it can only slip round a tree
or a bush, it suddenly settles on some dark spot, shuts
up its wings, and there remains motionless until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
danger is past. The rough, brown elm bark is a
favourite refuge under these circumstances; and it
takes a sharp eye to discover the butterfly when
settled.</p>

<p>Sometimes the creature is not quite so magnificent,
and even appears shorn of its fair proportions. I
have now such a specimen before me, which I found
on a sandy bank, unable to fly.</p>

<p>My attention was drawn to it by observing a
curious fluttering movement of the grasses that
covered the bank; and on going up to the spot to
see what was the cause, I discovered an Atalanta
butterfly that had apparently lost both wings of the
left side, and was endeavouring to fly with the remaining
pair. Of course it could only make short
leaps into the air, turn over, and again fall to the
ground. Wishing to put it out of pain, I killed it,
and on examination found that it had never been
endowed with wings on its left side, and that those
organs had still remained in the undeveloped state
in which they had lain under the chrysalis case.
Even the right pair had not attained their full development;
but in every other respect the insect was
perfect.</p>

<p>I suppose that the caterpillar must have selected
too dry a spot for its habitation when it became a
pupa; and that in consequence the pupa shell was
so dry and hard that the butterfly could not make its
escape in proper time, I have often seen similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
examples in my own caterpillar-breeding experiences.
There are also in one of my insect cases two specimens
of the little white butterfly, which have met
with even a worse fate; for they have not been able
to escape at all out of the chrysalis, and so present
the curious appearance of a chrysalis furnished with
head, antennæ, wings, and legs. The cause of the
disaster was probably the same in both cases.</p>

<p>The caterpillar of the Atalanta is shown on <a href="#plateD">plate
D</a>, fig. 4 <i>a</i>, and is a creature worthy of notice.</p>

<p>It is a well-known saying, that “what is one man’s
meat, is another’s poison”; and the proverb holds
good in the case of the Atalanta caterpillar. For its
meat is the common stinging-nettle, which is, undoubtedly,
poisonous enough to qualify any such
proverb.</p>

<p>The colour of the caterpillar is green-black, and
along each side runs a spotty yellowish band. Its
general shape and appearance can be seen by referring
to the figure.</p>

<p>After passing through the usual coat-changing
common to all caterpillars, it begins, just before its
last change, to prepare a spot where it may pass its
pupal state. Its mode of so doing is very curious,
and is briefly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The chrysalis is intended to remain in an attitude
which we should think singularly uncomfortable, but
which seems to suit the constitution of certain creatures,
such as bats and chrysalides; namely, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
head downward. Why some insects should be thus
suspended, while others lie horizontally, is not
known as yet. But there can be no doubt but
that some purpose is served by the various positions
and localities assumed by insects in their pupal state.</p>

<p>Any one of a reflective mind, on hearing that a
chrysalis was to be suspended by its tail, would feel
some perplexity as to the means by which such a
position could be attained. For the old caterpillar’s
skin has to be shed, and thus the legless, limbless
chrysalis is left without any apparent power to suspend
itself. The attitude which it assumes may be
seen on <a href="#plateD">plate D</a>, fig. 4 <i>b</i>. On examining the chrysalis
itself, and the leaf or twig to which it is suspended,
it will be seen that a little silken mound is
fastened to the leaf, and the chrysalis is furnished
with some hooked processes on its tail, which are
hitched upon the silken threads, and thus hold the
creature in the proper position.</p>

<p>The Peacock Butterfly, <a href="#plateH">plate H</a>, fig. 8, is an insect
of very similar habits and manners. The under side
of the wings is very dark, and when they are closed
over the back, the butterfly looks more like a flat
piece of brown paper than an insect. The spots on
the upper surface of the wing are especially beautiful;
and the mode in which those spots are coloured by
their feathers is shown in <a href="#plateL">plate L</a>, fig. 4, where a
portion of the wing-spot is slightly magnified. This
figure shows also the manner in which the feather-dust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of the butterfly’s wing is arranged. The larva
of this beautiful insect is shown on fig. 8 <i>b</i>. Like
that of the Atalanta, it feeds on the stinging-nettle.</p>

<p>On <a href="#plateD">plate D</a>, fig. 1, is drawn a very lovely insect,
one of the numerous blue butterflies that may be
seen flitting about the flowers in a garden, themselves
of so flower-like an azure, that they may often be
mistaken for a blue blossom. The caterpillar, fig.
1 <i>b</i>, is, as may be seen, rather curious in shape, and
the pupa, fig. 1 <i>c</i>, is hardly less so.</p>

<p>Among the scales of this insect occur certain specimens
called from their shape “battledore” scales,
some of which may be seen on <a href="#plateK">plate K</a>, fig. 8, contrasted
with the ordinary scales.</p>

<p>On the same plate as the blue butterfly, fig. 2, is
seen a very pretty and common insect, called the
“Orange-tip,” on account of the colour of the wings.
Only the male butterfly possesses these decorations,
the female having wings merely white above, although
she retains the beautiful green speckling of
the under-wings.</p>

<p>Two more butterflies, and those the commonest of
all, will complete this chapter. One will be at once
recognised from the drawing, <a href="#plateI">plate I</a>, fig. 4, as the
White Cabbage Butterfly. The specimen here represented
is the female; the male is smaller and has
darker spots.</p>

<p>This is the parent of those green and black caterpillars
which devastate our cabbage-beds, make sieves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of the leaves, and are so disagreeably tenacious of
their rights of possession. Pest as it is to the
gardeners, to cooks, and sometimes, alas! to consumers,
it would be a hundredfold worse but for the
exertions of a fly so small as hardly to be noticed,
but by its effects. This insect belongs to the same
order as the bees, and is shown upon <a href="#plateJ">plate J</a>, fig. 6.
Small though it be, one such insect can compass
the destruction of many a caterpillar, though not
one thousandth part of the size of a single victim.
While the caterpillar is feeding, the ichneumon fly,
as it is called, settles upon its back, pierces its skin
with a little drill, wherewith it is furnished, and in
the wound deposits an egg. This process is repeated
until the ichneumon’s work is done.</p>

<p>As each wound is made, the caterpillar seems to
wince, but shows no farther sense of uneasiness, and
proceeds with its eating as usual. But its food serves
very little for its own nourishment, because the
ichneumon’s eggs are speedily hatched into ichneumon
grubs, and consume the fatty portions of the
caterpillar as fast as it is formed.</p>

<p>In process of time the caterpillar ought to take the
chrysalis shape, and for that purpose leaves its food
and seeks a convenient spot for its change.</p>

<p>That change never comes, for the ichneumons
have been growing as fast as the caterpillar, with
whose development they keep pace. And no sooner
has their victim ceased to feed, than they simultaneously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
eat their way out of the doomed creature,
and immediately spin for themselves a number of
bright yellow cocoons, among which the dying caterpillar
is often hopelessly fixed. Sometimes it has
sufficient strength to escape, but it never survives.</p>

<p>In the later summer months, these cocoon masses
may be seen abundantly on walls, palings, and
similar spots.</p>

<p><a href="#plateI">Plate I</a>, fig. 3, shows the Brimstone Butterfly, one
of the first to appear as the herald of spring.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the remaining objects, only a very brief description
can be given. Enough, however, will be said
to assist the observer in identifying the object, and
to serve as a guide to its locality and manners. We
will first take the beetles; and as the largest is the
most conspicuous, the great Stag-beetle shall have
the precedence.</p>

<p>This insect (<a href="#plateE">plate E</a>, fig. 5) is quite unmistakable;
and, from its very ferocious aspect, would
deter many from touching it. But it is very lamb-like
in disposition, and sometimes as playful as a
lamb. Its numerous jaws can certainly pinch with
much violence; but are not used for the purpose of
killing other creatures, as might be supposed.</p>

<p>The food of the stag-beetle is simply the juices of
plants, which it sweeps up with that little brush-like
organ that may be seen in the very centre of
the jaws. In winter it buries itself in the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and then, making a smooth vault, abides the winter’s
cold unharmed.</p>

<p>Only the male beetle possesses these tremendous
jaws; those of the female being hardly one-tenth of
their size, but so sharp at their points that their bite
is just as severe.</p>

<p>The insect that next comes under notice is the
Musk-beetle (<a href="#plateI">plate I</a>, fig. 7), a beautiful and conspicuous
insect, of a rich green colour above, and a
purplish blue below. Its name of musk-beetle is
derived from the fragrant scent which it emits; a
scent, however, not the least like musk, but more
resembling that of roses. It is so powerful that the
presence of the insect may often be detected by the
nostrils, though it is hidden from the eyes. It may
be found chiefly on willow trees.</p>

<p>There is another beetle that gives out a sweet
scent, much resembling that of the verbena leaf.
This is the Tiger-beetle (<a href="#plateD">plate D</a>, fig. 8). With the
exception of the white spots on the wing covers, the
colours of this insect are much the same as those of
the musk-beetle.</p>

<p>Its name seems hardly commensurate with its
aspect; but never was a title better deserved. And,
space allowing, I could here draw a terrible character;
but as brevity is enforced, I can but say that this
sparkling and beautiful insect seems to have the
spirit of twenty tigers compressed into its little body.</p>

<p>All things have their opposites; and opposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
these perfume-bearing beetles are some who are just
insect skunks. Chief among these is the common
black Cock-tail, a creature of truly diabolical aspect.
It is a carrion eater, and intensifies the carrion odour.
Still, repulsive as it is, it has its beauties. Its wings
are very beautiful, and the mode in which these
organs are packed away under their small cases is
most wonderful. It is to aid in this process that the
cock-tail possesses the faculty of turning its tail over
its back. <a href="#plateH">Plate H</a>, fig. 12.</p>

<p>Another beetle of an abominable odour is the
Burying-beetle, one of which is shown on <a href="#plateC">plate C</a>,
fig. 8. There are many burying-beetles, but this
species is the most common.</p>

<p>Their name is derived from their habit of burying
any piece of meat or dead animal that may be lying
on the surface of the earth, not so much for the sake
of themselves as for their progeny. In the buried
animal their eggs are laid, and its putrefying substance
affords them nourishment. The rapidity with
which these and similar insects will consume even a
large animal is marvellous. I have seen a large
sheep stripped to the very bones in three days,
nothing but bones and wool being left to mark the
spot where it had lain.</p>

<p>Another kind of burying-beetle is seen on <a href="#plateB">plate B</a>,
fig. 7; but instead of dead meat it buries the droppings
of living animals, those of the cow being
preferred. For this purpose it drives a perpendicular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
shaft into the ground, makes up a round ball of the
droppings, puts an egg into the middle of the ball,
rolls it into the hole, and after pushing some earth
after it, sets to work at another shaft.</p>

<p>It is evident how beneficial the labours of these
insects must be; for by their means the earth is
pierced with passages for air&mdash;part is thrown out on
the surface, where it becomes regenerated by the
atmosphere&mdash;noxious substances are removed from
the surface, where they would do harm, and placed
deep in the ground, where they do good.</p>

<p>The popular name for this beetle is the Watchman,
because in the dusk of the evening it “wheels
its drowsy flight,” much as watchmen made their
sleepy rounds. It belongs to the same family of
insects as the sacred Scarabæus of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>On <a href="#plateC">plate C</a>, fig. 11, is depicted the common Rose-beetle
so called because it is an insect of refined
habits, and chiefly dwells in the bosom of white
roses. Yet it loves earth too, and in pursuance of
its mission falls from its rose to earth, and there
digs a receptacle for its future progeny. But though
in earth, it is not of earth; and, burrow as it may,
it returns to its rose without a stain upon its
burnished wings.</p>

<p>The curious Glow-worm, as it is called falsely, it
being a beetle, and not a worm, is shown on <a href="#plateJ">plate J</a>,
fig. 1. Both the male and female insect give out
this light, as I have often seen, though that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
female is the more powerful. The two sexes are
very different in appearance, as may be seen by
reference to the plate, fig. 1 being the male, and 1 <i>a</i>
the female. The object of the light is by no means
certain, nor the mode in which it is produced.</p>

<p>On the same plate, fig. 11, is seen the Oil-beetle,
an eccentric kind of insect, which, when frightened,
pours a drop of oil out of every joint, just as if it
were a walking oil-barrel with self-acting taps.</p>

<p>One of the commonest beetles, the Ground-beetle,
is seen on the same plate, fig. 10. There are very
many ground-beetles, but this is one of the handsomest
and most conspicuous. The embossment of
its upper surface is worth a close examination, and
its colouring is peculiarly rich and deep.</p>

<p>Hot sunny days always seem to bring out a host
of insects, among which the Sun-beetles are notable
examples. One of these insects is shown on <a href="#plateD">plate
D</a>, fig. 6. They are beautifully brilliant as they run
among the gravel-stones or over paths, their smooth
surface glittering in the sun resplendently.</p>

<p>As an aquatic balance to the terrene Sun-beetles,
the Whirligigs (<a href="#plateF">plate F</a>, fig. 4) make their appearance
on the surface of the water on any light sunny day.
What rule they observe in their mazy dance is more
difficult to comprehend than the “Lancers” or a
cotillon: but that there must be a rule is clear from
the wonderful way in which they avoid striking
against each other in their passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Every one knows the Lady Bird, with its pretty
red wings and black spots. Its larva (<a href="#plateB">plate B</a>,
fig. 8) is a very singular creature, and destructive
withal, spearing and eating Aphides as ruthlessly as
Polyphemus impaled and devoured the captured
sailors. It has a curious history, but there is no
room for it here.</p>

<p>On <a href="#plateH">plate H</a>, fig. 7, is represented one of the many
Skipjack-beetles, who afford such amusement to
juveniles by their sudden leaps into the air when laid
on their backs. This feat is performed by means of
a sudden blow of the head and thorax. Farmers,
however, are not all amused by it, for it is the parent
of the terrible “wire-worm,” so deadly a foe to corn
and potatoes.</p>

<p>Some insects prefer com when placed in granaries,
and these are the Weevils, whose grubs populate sea-biscuit,
and run races across plates for wagers. Nuts
also fall victims to the weevil represented on <a href="#plateI">plate
I</a>, fig. 9, or rather to its grub, “Time out of mind
the fairies’ coachmaker”.</p>

<p>There is a very common little green weevil shown
on <a href="#plateC">plate C</a>, fig. 7, which, although ordinary enough
to the unassisted eye, yet under the microscope
glows with jewels and gold. It is, in truth, the
British Diamond-beetle. An idea of its appearance
may be obtained from <a href="#plateL">plate L</a>, fig. 6, but to give the
real glory of the colouring is impossible.</p>

<p>One of the little insects called Death-watches is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
shown on <a href="#plateJ">plate J</a>, fig. 8. There are many insects
that go by this name, because they make a slight
tapping sound with their heads, probably to call
their mates; and which sound has been thought to
prognosticate death rather than marriage.</p>

<p>The curious Tortoise-beetle is depicted on <a href="#plateC">plate
C</a>, fig. 6. Its chief peculiarity is in its larval state,
when it carries a kind of parasol, formed from the
remains of the leaves on which it has been feeding.</p>

<p>Last and least of the beetles comes one as destructive
as it is small, the Turnip-hopper. This
little animal, no larger than a small pin’s head, does
great damage to the turnip crops, and is therefore
hated by farmers. It is shown, much magnified, on
<a href="#plateJ">plate J</a>, fig. 13.</p>

<p>From the beetles we proceed to the Bee tribe; and
first take the common Humble-bee, several of which
are shown on <a href="#plateH">plate H</a>, fig. 10, representing the
“Red-hipped Humble-bee,” which mostly makes its
nest among stone-heaps. Fig. 11 is the common
Humble-bee, that burrows in the ground, and there
builds its thimble-like cells. These cells are very
irregular in shape, and are affixed to each other
without any definite order. Of these two insects,
the latter is harmless enough; but the former becomes
very fierce if its nest is approached too
closely.</p>

<p>A magnified view of some hairs of the Humble-bee
is given on <a href="#plateK">plate K</a>, fig. 11.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>There are some bees which make their nests in
old walls, where they either dig for themselves a
hole, or oftener take advantage of a nail-hole, and so
save themselves much trouble. One of these bees is
shown on <a href="#plateH">plate H</a>, fig. 2, and is chiefly remarkable
for the beautifully tufted extremities of its middle
pair of legs.</p>

<p>On <a href="#plateD">plate D</a>, fig. 7, is seen the common Hornet,
one of the really terrible of our insects. It mostly
makes its nest in hollow trees, and it behoves one to
keep very clear of the neighbourhood. The nest is
made of wood-fibre, nibbled, and made into a primitive
papier-maché.</p>

<p>Two of the Saw-flies may be seen on <a href="#plateJ">plate J</a>.
Fig. 2 is the common green Saw-fly, and fig. 3 the
dreaded Turnip-fly. These are called Saw-flies because
they are furnished with saw-like implements,
by means of which they cut grooves in certain plants,
and in those grooves lay their eggs.</p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the little Ichneumon
fly. One of these insects is shown magnified
on <a href="#plateJ">plate J</a>, fig. 12 <i>a</i>, and one of the large species
is depicted on <a href="#plateH">plate H</a>, fig. 3. The threefold appendage
to the tail is the ovipositor, or instrument by
means of which they pierce their victims and deposit
their eggs.</p>

<p>There are some allied insects that pierce vegetables
instead of insects; and one of their works may be
seen figured on <a href="#plateA">plate A</a>, where a bramble-branch has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
been perforated by them. The well-known oak-apples,
<a href="#plateB">plate B</a>, fig. 6, are caused by a Cynips, as
the little creature is called; and so is the common
Bedeguar of the rose, seen on <a href="#plateC">plate C</a>, fig. 2.</p>

<p>The last of these insects that will be named is the
beautiful Fire-tail, <a href="#plateD">plate D</a>, fig. 5, one of the most
brilliant insects that our island can boast. There
are many British species of this insect, but they all
much resemble each other, and are insect cuckoos,
laying their eggs in the nests of other insects.</p>

<p>From the bees, we pass to the Flies; and first
take a most singular insect, shown on <a href="#plateH">plate H</a>, fig.
5. This insect is found on the blackberry blossoms,
and the upper part of its body is so transparent that
the leaf on which it sits can be seen through it. It
is swift of wing and wary, requiring a quick eye and
hand for its capture.</p>

<p>On the same plate, fig. 6, is shown one of the
traveller’s pests, a fly that bites, or rather bores, the
skin, and that with such virulence that it can even
strike its poisoned dart through a cloth coat, and
make its victim to lament for many an hour
after.</p>

<p>One of the various hoverer-flies is shown on <a href="#plateJ">plate
J</a>, fig. 9. The larva of this insect is very remarkable,
on account of its curious breathing apparatus.
The larva is properly called the Rat-tailed Maggot,
and is shown on the same plate, fig. 8 <i>a</i>. The body
of the creature is found buried in the mud at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
bottom of stagnant pools or cisterns, and the respiration
is carried on through the telescopic tail,
which is long enough to protrude through the mud, and
to convey the necessary oxygen to the system through
two flexible air-tubes that pass through the “tail”.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in mentioning the
Green Oak Moth, the Destroying Empis was also
noticed. One of these flies is shown on <a href="#plateJ">plate J</a>, fig.
5, with the poor Tortrix in its grasp. <a href="#plateK">Plate K</a>, fig.
1, shows its foot, and fig. 3 its head, together with
its long beak.</p>

<p>The beak of this fly somewhat reminds one of the
corresponding portion of the Gnat, which insect is
not itself depicted, though on <a href="#plateF">plate F</a>, fig. 10, is
shown the wonderful little egg-boat which it makes.
This insect glues together its eggs in such a manner
that they are formed into a true lifeboat, which
cannot be upset, or sunk, or filled with water, but
floats securely on the surface until the young are
hatched. That object accomplished, the gnat-larvæ
tumble into the water, and there undergo their
transformation.</p>

<p>The last of the two-winged flies that will be mentioned
is the common Daddy Long Legs, or Crane-fly,
which seems to set such little value on its limbs.
It is a very injurious insect in its larval state, feeding
on roots, and doing great damage. <a href="#plateH">Plate H</a>, fig. 1,
shows a very pretty species, covered with yellow rings.</p>

<p>Every one must have noticed the beautiful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
active insects that are with great truth called
Dragon-flies. Their habits and peculiarities would
demand a volume; and here they can but be mentioned.
<a href="#plateF">Plate F</a>, fig. 6, shows the common Flat
Dragon-fly, that may be seen chasing and following
flies of all sizes, and even butterflies. Fig. 8 is the
elegant Demoiselle, the male of which is shown here,
with its dark purple spots on the wings and dark
blue body. The female is of a uniform green. Its
larva is shown at fig. 8 <i>a</i>, where the singular leafy
gills may be seen at the end of its tail. Fig. 7 shows
another very common Dragon-fly, very thin and
ringed with blue circlets.</p>

<p>On the same plate, fig. 12, may be seen several
varieties of the objects known to fishermen as “Caddis”
cases. These are residences built by the larva
of the common Caddis, or Stone-fly, which is represented
on the same plate, fig. 9.</p>

<p>Still keeping to <a href="#plateF">plate F</a>, and referring to fig. 1, is
seen the horrid-looking Water-scorpion, a creature
which, though it does not sting, has much of the
scorpion nature, and so bites. Fig. 1 <i>a</i> shows the
same insect as it appears when flying.</p>

<p>At fig. 3 is seen the Water Boatman, so called because
it lies on its back, which is ridged like the keel
of a boat, and then rows itself about by means of its
middle pair of legs, which closely resemble oars.</p>

<p>Fig. 5 shows a very curious object which is common
enough on the margin of pools, and runs on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
surface of the water as if it were dry land. When
alarmed, it shuts up all its legs, and looks just like a
piece of dry grass or thin stick.</p>

<p>Another insect much resembling it, is the common
Gerris, seen on <a href="#plateI">plate I</a>, fig. 6. It may be seen on
every pond or still water, running over its surface,
and is furnished with wings wherewith it can fly to
great distances. I have found specimens on the tops
of hills, far from any water, and hiding under stones
out of the sun’s heat. Fig. 1 shows the common
May-fly.</p>

<p>All gardeners have been annoyed with the curious
production called the Cuckoo-spit. This proceeds
from the larva of one of the hoppers, and on removing
the frothy substance, the little soft, greenish
insect may be found within. The perfect insect is
shown on <a href="#plateC">plate C</a>, fig. 1 <i>a</i>, and the exudation itself
at fig. 1.</p>

<p>There is another hopper seen on <a href="#plateB">plate B</a>, fig. 2,
called from its colour the Scarlet Hopper. It is
common enough on ferns, and may be found chiefly
in the open spots of forests where ferns abound.</p>

<p>On <a href="#plateJ">plate J</a>, fig. 7 <i>a</i>, is the common Green Grasshopper,
as it appears when standing; and on fig. 7,
the same insect as it appears when using its wings.</p>

<p>The common Earwig, <a href="#plateI">plate I</a>, fig. 8, is introduced
for the purpose of showing the very beautiful wing
which this insect possesses, and which is seen expanded
at fig. 8 <i>a</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>The very lovely, though ill-odoured, Lace-wing
Fly is shown on <a href="#plateJ">plate J</a>, fig. 4, and its very remarkable
eggs at 4 <i>a</i>. Each egg is placed at the end of
a footstalk, whereby it is kept out of the reach of
certain predacious insects.</p>

<p>Various shells are drawn on one or two of the
plates, but there is not space for any description.
Their names may be found on the Index to Plates.
<a href="#plateG">Plate G</a> contains certain fungi and mosses. Fig. 1
is that peculiar plant which reindeer scrape from
under the snow in the winter time. Fig. 2 was once
dreaded by rustics as “Witch’s butter”. Fig. 6
shows the curious Earth-star, chiefly remarkable for
its resemblance to the marine Star-fish.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
